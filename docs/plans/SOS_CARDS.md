# Card-implementation push — Secrets of Strixhaven (`sos`, 271 distinct cards)

Standing workstream: implement the Secrets of Strixhaven set for **limited (40-card) play** in
`mtg-core`, easiest-first, correctness over count. This ledger is the capability index + full
per-card triage, modeled on `SELESNYA_LANDFALL_CARDS.md`.

## ▶ NEXT AGENT — start here (handoff from sos-cards-9, 2026-07-04)

**▶▶ sos-cards-9 HANDOFF (2026-07-04) — READ FIRST. SCOPE = FULL SET; quality bar = general CR capability,
not the minimal hack.** 158→162 authored / all fully-faithful, **598 mtg-core tests green, tree clean** (LEAD
pushes). Shipped **5 caps + 4 cards + the missing Swamp basic land** (each a real-path test, `git commit --only`
on the shared tree; MuZero's `experiments/` untouched):
1. **S12 target-dependent cost reduction** (`583f30f`) — the risky sub-cap agent-8 deferred. `CostReduction`'s
   condition is now `CostReductionCondition::{State(Condition) | TargetMatches(CardFilter)}`; `effective_cast_cost`
   takes a `TargetCtx::{Optimistic | Chosen(&targets)}`. Offer gate applies a target-dependent discount
   optimistically (a legal matching target exists); `cast_spell` recomputes the final cost from the CHOSEN
   targets AND constrains each target slot's candidates to what the caster can pay (reductions only lower cost →
   base affordable keeps all, else only discount-granting targets) — auto_pay never underpays, **no rewind**.
   + `CardFilter::Tapped`/`Untapped`. → **Ajani's Response** (real-cast test proves the untapped creature is not
   offered when only the reduced cost is affordable). Orysa migrated to `State(...)`.
2. **enters-tapped MoveZone** (`9bd7fa1`) — `tapped: bool` on `Effect::MoveZone` + `Action::MoveZone` (set after
   `move_object` re-untaps, CR 110.5; mirrors `Effect::Search{tapped}`). → **Teacher's Pest** (gy→battlefield
   tapped). **Also registered the missing Swamp basic land** (`grp::SWAMP=5` — no black basic existed!).
3. **Exile-as-cost** (`eadceae`) — wired `CostComponent::Exile(SelectSpec)` (was defined-but-unpaid;
   `exile_cost_candidates`/`pay_exile_cost` mirror the Discard pair, exclude the source). → **Postmortem Professor**.
   Reusable for escape/delve. **The graveyard-recursion trio (Summoned Dromedary/Teacher's Pest/Postmortem) is
   now COMPLETE.**
4. **graveyard-functioning triggers (NEW CLASS)** (`5b79e8d`-range) — `Ability::FunctionsFrom(Vec<Zone>)` marker
   (lead-approved **Design B generalized**: battlefield is the implicit default zone-of-function, only deviating
   cards carry the marker; CR 113.6; generalizes to hand/exile by adding zones) + `collect_triggers` graveyard
   scan + batched `EventPattern::YouDealCombatDamageToPlayer` (`GameEvent::CombatDamageToPlayerBy`, once/controller/
   combat-damage-step) + **`Effect::MayPayCost{cost,then}`** ("you may pay …; if you do, …" — the mana analogue of
   `IfYouDo`, broadly reusable). → **Killian's Confidence** (real-path: combat damage → gy trigger → pay {W/B} →
   return self; + the declined/unpayable path stays in gy).

**▶ RECOMMENDED NEXT ORDER (all remaining need a genuine subsystem — none is a quick win):**
- **Diary of Dreams** — activated-ability cost reduction (a natural extension of the S12 cast-time work applied at
  `activate_ability` + the activated-ability offer gate ~priority.rs:1164 `can_pay_cost`). Scoped plan: **(a)** page
  counter = `CounterKind::Named("page")` — **zero enum churn** (reuse the existing Named variant); **(b)** give
  `Ability::CostReduction` a `scope: CostReductionScope::{Cast|ActivatedAbilities}` field (migrate the 2 existing
  literals — Orysa, Ajani — to `Cast`) and add an `effective_activation_cost(source, &Cost)->Cost` sibling of
  `effective_cast_cost` that applies `ActivatedAbilities`-scoped reductions to the cost's *mana* (a
  `GenericValue(Count{page counters on self})` amount); apply it at the offer gate AND in `activate_ability`
  before `pay_cost`; **(c)** a `SpellCast(I/S)`→`PutCounters(page)` trigger (machinery exists — see S22/S8). Then
  the `{5},{T}: Draw` ability. Low-churn, squarely S12.
- **The big three (DESIGN-SKETCH TO THE LEAD BEFORE EACH; lead wants Planeswalkers first — most groundwork):**
  Planeswalkers (CR 306/606 — `CostComponent::Loyalty` + a PW-dies test already exist), Lessons/Learn (CR 715
  outside-the-game/sideboard), Prepare-DFCs (~36, the card-faces model — the biggest piece).
- **Remaining S12 cards** (target-dependent MECHANISM done; each blocked on a DIFFERENT secondary): **Run Behind**
  (uses the new cap w/ `Attacking` filter; needs "put target on top OR bottom of owner's library, owner chooses"
  — an owner-side binary decision, no clean existing primitive — a small decision-plumbing effect); **Brush Off**
  (uses the cap w/ the `Cost({1}{U})` arm + an I/S-spell filter; ALSO needs `TargetKind::StackObject` candidate
  enumeration in the real cast path — `target_candidates` returns empty for StackObject, so counterspells are only
  tested via `resolve_effect` — a separate cap + stack-target filter matching); **Diary of Dreams** (activated-
  ability cost reduction — a per-ability variant of my cast-time work applied at `activate_ability`; + a Page
  `CounterKind` + a SpellCast-I/S→add-page-counter trigger); **The Dawning Archaic** (`GenericValue(Count{I/S in
  gy})` arm already built — the reduction is DONE; needs a free-cast-an-I/S-from-gy-on-attack trigger);
  **Wilt in the Heat** (reduction is FREE via `State(CardLeftGraveyardThisTurn)` — existing pipeline; needs a
  "if that creature would die this turn, exile it instead" delayed replacement rider).
- **The big three (DESIGN-SKETCH TO THE LEAD BEFORE EACH):** Lessons/Learn (CR 715 outside-the-game/sideboard),
  Planeswalkers (CR 306/606 — `CostComponent::Loyalty` + a PW-dies test already exist), Prepare-DFCs (~36, the
  card-faces model — the biggest piece).

**PROCESS (unchanged, hard-won):** shared tree → `git commit --only <paths>` (stage a NEW file with `git add`
first), never `-a`/`add -A`/stash; DON'T touch `experiments/` (MuZero + GPU runs live there); `cargo test -p
mtg-core` green at every commit; flip a cap's ledger Status cell in the SAME commit; **`git log -S "<mechanism>"`
+ READ THE CODE before scoping any ⏳ row as new** (beliefs have drifted in both directions). Real-path integration
test (cast/activate→pay→target→resolve) for every mechanism; expect-test snapshots (`UPDATE_EXPECT=1` to regen).
Ping the lead at subsystem boundaries + design sketches for new classes / the big three. On fatigue: declare,
rewrite THIS block, hand off clean.

### ▶ Systemic notes (cross-cutting — read before scoping cost/targeting/counterspell work)
- **No-rewind is a pragmatic economy, NOT architecture law** (user directive, 2026-07-04). The cast path
  currently pre-masks so nothing needs undoing (target-dependent cost modifiers filter target candidates by
  affordability — see `cast_spell`). Keep exact pre-filtering where it stays cheap (RL values exact masks), but
  when a mechanic makes pre-filtering **combinatorial** (convoke/improvise-class alt-payments, stacked cost
  modifiers × restricted mana, modal×X×affordability), the sanctioned path is a **transactional pending-cast**:
  snapshot/hold the cast context, allow cancel/rollback before commitment — exactly MTGA's GRE pending-cast+cancel
  model (mirroring the GRE is a project goal). Don't contort future designs to preserve no-rewind. Recorded in
  `docs/design/WHITEBOARD_MODEL.md` §2.6. The candidate filter already consumes each candidate's *full* effective
  cost (not "reduction present"), so a future target-dependent cost **increase** works by construction.
- **Counterspell targeting has NEVER gone through the real cast path (latent gap).** `target_candidates` returns
  `Vec::new()` for `TargetKind::StackObject` (priority.rs ~2176 `_ => Vec::new()`), so a spell that "counters
  target spell" would rewind if cast for real — every counterspell (Essence Scatter, Cost of Brilliance, etc.) is
  only tested via `resolve_effect`-direct with a hand-built `Target::Stack`. Wiring StackObject candidate
  enumeration + `target_matches_filter` for `Target::Stack` (currently returns `true` = matches-anything) is its
  own cap; it blocks **Brush Off** (S12 target-dependent-on-a-spell) and real-path counterspell play.

### Prior handoff — sos-cards-8 (superseded by the block above, kept for provenance)

**▶▶ sos-cards-8 HANDOFF (2026-07-04) — SCOPE IS NOW THE FULL SET** (T4 deferral REVOKED —
prepare-DFCs, Lessons, planeswalkers, spell-copy, Fractalize, all subsystems in scope). Quality bar:
each subsystem built as the GENERAL CR capability, not the minimal hack. **153→158 authored / 155 fully-
faithful / 3 tracked-partial, 586 mtg-core tests green, tree clean (commits local, not yet pushed — ask lead).**
Shipped **5 cards + 5 caps**, each with a real-path test, via `git commit --only` on the shared tree:
1. **`Effect::DirectedDiscard` + `TargetKind::Player(PlayerFilter)`** (`4faa6d9`) — "target opponent reveals
   hand, YOU choose a nonland, they discard it" (chooser ≠ discarder, CR 701.8) + a general player-target
   restriction (`Any`/`Opponent`/`You`; `Effect::TargetPlayer` now carries the filter — 5 existing consumers
   updated to `Any`). → **Render Speechless**.
2. **`CostComponent::ActivateFromGraveyard`** (`4b70bc1`) — a pure graveyard-usability marker (no cost effect)
   decoupling "this activated ability functions from the graveyard" from S18's `ExileSelfFromGraveyard` (which
   is marker AND exile cost); the graveyard scan accepts either. → **Summoned Dromedary** (`{1}{W}`: return
   self gy→hand, via `MoveZone{SourceSelf→Hand}`).
3. **LKI dies-triggers (CR 603.10a)** (`3ef761d`) — **load-bearing.** New `GameState.last_known: BTreeMap<ObjId,
   Lki>` (Lki = computed chars + controller), captured in `move_object` when a permanent LEAVES the battlefield
   (before status/controller reset); `ComputedChars` gained serde. Wired `EventPattern::CreatureDies(filter)`
   (was defined-but-unfired) via `queue_watching_dies_triggers` + a new LKI-aware `dies_filter_matches` (the
   dies analogue of `enter_filter_matches`, reading the LKI snapshot). + `CardFilter::ToughnessAtMost`. →
   **Arnyn, Deathbloom Botanist** (deathtouch + drain when a P/T≤1 creature you control dies) + **Cauldron of
   Essence** (drain when a creature you control dies + sac-cost sorcery reanimation). ⚠️ **LKI groundwork for
   the WHOLE future** — every dies/LTB-trigger and "draw cards = its power"-style effect should read `last_known`.
   Only the FILTER path reads LKI so far; when a dies-trigger's *effect/value* needs the dead object's stats,
   thread the LKI into `ResolutionCtx` (not built yet — no consumer). `SelfDies` effects still read the live
   (graveyard) object; fine for current self-dies cards, revisit when one reads its own dying stats.
4. **S12 cost-reduction pipeline (CR 601.2f / 118)** (`9621fef`) — `Ability::CostReduction{amount, condition}`
   (`CostReductionAmount::{Generic(u32)|GenericValue(ValueExpr)|Cost(ManaCost)}`) + `effective_cast_cost(p,card,
   base)` applied at BOTH the offer gate AND `cast_spell` (so affordability == payment for state/count conditions)
   + `ValueExpr::TotalToughness`. → **Orysa** (costs {3} less if creatures you control total toughness ≥10).
   ⚠️ **Only state/count conditions so far** (exact affordability). **Target-dependent** (Ajani's Response, Brush
   Off, Run Behind) is a distinct sub-cap: the reduction depends on CHOSEN targets, so the offer gate must be
   optimistic (offer if a qualifying target EXISTS makes it affordable) and the actual reduction computed from
   chosen targets at cast — mind the no-rewind invariant (over-offer → auto_pay underpays). The `GenericValue`
   and `Cost` (coloured) arms are built but not yet exercised by a card.

**▶ NEXT AGENT — recommended order (adjust with judgment; the lead's suggested order is in the brief):**
- **S12 cost-reduction — finish it.** The general pipeline is IN (`effective_cast_cost`, state/count conditions,
  Orysa). Remaining 6 cards need: (a) **target-dependent affordability** (Ajani's Response — Destroy target
  creature, {3} less if targets a TAPPED creature — is FULLY faithful once this lands; also Brush Off, Run Behind).
  Add `CostReductionAmount`/condition awareness of chosen targets: offer gate optimistic (a qualifying target
  exists → reduced), actual reduction from chosen targets at cast; guard the no-rewind invariant. (b) **coloured
  reduction** consumer (Brush Off's {1}{U}, `Cost` arm built) + Counter (built). (c) **activated-ability cost
  reduction** (Diary of Dreams — attach a reduction to an `Activated` ability, per page counter). (d) **Wilt in
  the Heat** ({2} less if `CardLeftGraveyardThisTurn`, cond built — trivial; needs an exile-if-would-die
  replacement rider). (e) **The Dawning Archaic** (`GenericValue(Count{I/S in gy})`, arm built) + S10-on-attack.
- **Enters-tapped** (`ZoneDest` has no tapped flag; 43 literals so DON'T add a required field — add a small
  builder or a separate `Effect::MoveZone` tapped variant / an entering-tapped continuous). Unblocks the rest of
  graveyard-recursion (**Teacher's Pest** gy→battlefield tapped) + Mind Roots / Mind into Matter enters-tapped.
- **Postmortem Professor** — needs an exile-an-I/S-from-gy cost variant (like `ExileSelfFromGraveyard` but exile
  a DIFFERENT gy card) + a "can't block" qualification (Defender = can't-attack; can't-block is separate) + the
  `ActivateFromGraveyard` marker (done) for its gy→battlefield reanimation.
- **Killian's Confidence** — triggered-ability-that-functions-from-graveyard (combat-damage trigger → pay {W/B}
  → return self gy→hand). A NEW class: triggered (not activated) abilities usable from the graveyard.
- Then the lead's list: dynamic-ManaValue filters, blink-with-delayed-return, move-counters, grant-arbitrary-
  ability (layer 6), repeatable-modal + dynamic-X targeting, spell-copy, Fractalize.
- **The big three (design-sketch to the lead BEFORE building):** Lessons/Learn (OutsideTheGame zone), Planeswalkers
  (NOTE: `CostComponent::Loyalty` + a `planeswalker_enters_with_loyalty_and_dies_at_zero` test ALREADY exist —
  groundwork is partly there; read it first), Prepare-DFCs (36 — card-faces model, biggest piece).

**PROCESS (unchanged, hard-won):** shared tree → `git commit --only <paths>` (stage a NEW file with `git add`
first), never `-a`/`add -A`/stash; DON'T touch `experiments/` (muzero-debug lives there + GPU runs); `cargo test
-p mtg-core` green at every commit; flip a cap's ledger Status cell in the SAME commit; **`git log -S "<mechanism>"`
+ READ THE CODE before scoping any ⏳ row as new** (several drifted stale historically); real-path integration
test (cast→pay→target→resolve) for every mechanism. Ping the lead at subsystem boundaries. On fatigue: declare,
rewrite THIS block, hand off clean.

## Prior handoffs (superseded by the block above, kept for provenance)

**▶▶ sos-cards-7 HANDOFF (2026-07-03) — 153 authored / 150 fully-faithful / 3 tracked-partial,
575 mtg-core tests green, tree clean, all pushed.** Shipped **5 caps + 4 cards**, each with a real-path test
(activation-with-X, put-then-double, YouAttack-trigger-on-`AttackersDeclared`, distinct-named-lands activation),
all committed via `git commit --only` on the shared tree:
1. **{X}-in-an-activated-cost** (`7102d4a`) — `activate_ability` now `ChooseNumber{ChooseX}`s (bounded by affordable
   mana), folds `chosen_x*pips` into generic, carries X on the stack object; ability-resolution `ResolutionCtx.x`
   was hardcoded `None` → now `obj.x`. → **Berta, Wise Extrapolator** (all 3 clauses).
2. **S20 `ValueExpr::CountersOnTarget{target,kind}` + flush-before-`PutCounters`** (`6fe5aaf`) — the `PutCounters`
   interpret arm now flushes staged actions first (mirrors CreateToken's #61 flush) so "put a +1/+1, then double"
   reads the post-first count. → **Growth Curve**. Full suite confirms **no counter-card regression**.
3. **`CardFilter::Attacking`** (`e5207a1`) — matches a current declared attacker (`CombatState::is_attacking`),
   added to `target_matches_filter` + exhaustive `count_filter_matches`. → **Living History** (ETB Spirit +
   `YouAttack`/S9-gated pump on a target attacking creature).
4. **`ValueExpr::DistinctNames{zone,filter,controller}`** (distinct card-names among matching objects) + wired
   **`CardFilter::HasCounter` into the layer-system static-scope matcher** (`chars/mod.rs::matches_filter`, was
   `_ => false`) (`9b0937f`) → **Emil, Vastlands Roamer** (counter-gated trample anthem + `{4}{G},{T}` Fractal with
   X = differently-named lands). ⚠️ Corrected the sos-cards-6 belief that {X}-activated-cost would clear Emil — it
   would NOT; Emil's X = differently-named lands, not a paid {X} (always verify the oracle).

**▶ NEXT AGENT — the moderate queue is now down to heavier single-card caps (each ~1–2 caps, one card):**
- **directed-discard `Effect`** → **Render Speechless** (`{2}{W}{B}`): "target opponent reveals their hand, YOU
  choose a nonland card, that player discards it" + "put two +1/+1 counters on up to one target creature." Needs a
  NEW interactive `Effect` leaf (reveal target player's hand → the CHOOSER/caster picks a matching card → that
  player discards it — unlike `interpret_discard` where the discarder chooses) + a player target (slot 0) and a
  creature target (slot 1). Only unblocks THIS card in SOS (scoped 2026-07-03).
- **Treasure token with an ACTIVATED mana ability** → **Seize the Spoils** (`khm`): a token with `{T}, Sacrifice:
  add one mana of any color`. ⚠️ HEAVIER than it looks — that's a *sacrifice-cost mana ability*, and the mana
  payment path (`auto_pay`/`usable_mana_sources`) only *taps* sources; it has no "sacrifice for mana" support.
  Verify/extend the mana system before scoping as cheap. (S11 did only TRIGGERED token abilities.)
- **Slumbering Trudge** — stun-counter core is authorable now (S3 done); its "enters tapped unless X≤2" clause needs
  X threaded into `EntersTappedUnless`'s condition eval (whiteboard.rs ~1454 evals with no X ctx) — or defer that
  one clause and ship tracked-partial.
- Bigger subsystems stay **DEFERRED** (lower ROI): spell-copy (~1 net card), move-counters, cost-reduction (S12),
  dynamic-ManaValue, blink-with-delayed-return, graveyard-play, grant-arbitrary-ability, Fractalize (= milestone-5
  SET color/type layers), LKI dies-triggers. 36 prepare-DFC + 2 planeswalkers + 5 Lessons stay deferred by type.

**PROCESS (unchanged, hard-won):** shared tree → `git commit --only <paths>` (stage a NEW file with `git add`
first, then `--only` it), never `-a`/`add -A`/stash; don't touch `experiments/`; `cargo test -p mtg-core` green at
every commit; flip a cap's ledger Status cell in the SAME commit; **`git log -S "<mechanism>"` + READ THE CODE
before scoping any ⏳ row as new** (multiple prose beliefs were wrong in BOTH directions). Ping the lead at cap
boundaries. On fatigue: declare, rewrite THIS block, hand off clean.

**▶▶ sos-cards-6 handoff (2026-07-03 late night) — READ THIS FIRST. FIRST-PASS MILESTONE DECLARED: 149 authored /
146 fully-faithful / 3 tracked-partial, 562 mtg-core tests green, tree clean, all pushed.** Shipped **8 cards + 8
engine caps + corrected a wrong "first-strike unwired" belief** (first/double-strike combat has been done since
`a15015f`; passing tests prove it — the handoff was wrong). Caps (all with real-path tests): (1) **per-turn
counter-added tracker** `Condition::PutCounterOnSelfThisTurn` (`Object.counter_added_this_turn`, set in the
`AddCounters` executor) → **Fractal Tender**; (2) **`Effect::ForEachTarget{slot,body}`** (apply-to-each of a
VARIABLE multi-target slot, reusing `EffectTarget::Each`; `foreach_current` generalized `ObjId`→`Target` so `Each`
binds players too) → **Homesickness** + **Prismari Charm**; (3) **S19 `ValueExpr::CardsDrawnThisTurn`** → **Fractal
Anomaly**; (4) **`ValueExpr::XOfTriggeringSpell`** (`Object.cast_x` recorded at cast) — completes S21 → **Geometer's
Arthropod**; (5) **"counters put on self" `EventPattern::CountersPutOnSelf{kind}`** + `GameEvent::CountersPut`
broadcast from the `AddCounters` executor → **Pensive Professor**; (6) **S22 `Condition::CastInstantOrSorceryThis
Turn`** (`Player.instants_sorceries_cast_this_turn`); (7) **`Restriction::OnlyIf` wired into the activated-ability
legality gate** (was only honoured for mana abilities) → **Potioner's Trove**; (8) a reusable **`artifact()`**
CardDef builder. Also two zero-cap cards the audit surfaced: **Withering Curse** + **Prismari Charm**.

**KEY LESSON (again): the ledger's "no-cap vein is mined out" was WRONG.** A fresh unauthored-card audit (verified
vs the interpreter) found 2 zero-cap cards + a vein of 1-small-cap cards. **The genuinely-cheap vein is now swept.**
What remains all needs a MODERATE new capability (verified — don't scope as "cheap"):
- ~~**`{X}` in an ACTIVATED ability cost**~~ **DONE (sos-cards-7)** — `activate_ability` now `ChooseNumber{ChooseX}`s
  (bounded by affordable mana), folds `chosen_x * pips` into generic, carries X on the stack object; the
  ability-resolution `ResolutionCtx.x` was hardcoded `None`, now `obj.x`. → **Berta, Wise Extrapolator** authored
  (all 3 clauses fully-faithful, 3 real-path tests incl. legality→pay→resolve activation with X=3). ⚠️ **The handoff
  belief that this ALSO clears Emil was WRONG** — verify-the-oracle: Emil's `{4}{G},{T}` uses X = differently-named
  lands, NOT a paid `{X}`. Emil still needs a **`DistinctNamedLands` value** (unbuilt) + its conditional trample anthem.
- ~~**`ValueExpr::CountersOnTarget(n)` + a commit-between-steps flush**~~ **DONE (sos-cards-7)** → **Growth Curve**.
  Added `ValueExpr::CountersOnTarget { target, kind }` (reads live count of a counter kind on the Nth chosen target)
  + a flush-before-`PutCounters` interpret arm (mirrors CreateToken's #61 flush) so "put a +1/+1, THEN double" reads
  the post-first-counter count. Full suite (568) confirms no counter-card regression.
- ~~**`CardFilter::Attacking`** (combat-state filter)~~ **DONE (sos-cards-7)** → **Living History** (ETB Spirit + a
  `YouAttack`/S9-gated pump on a target attacking creature). Added `CardFilter::Attacking` (matches a current
  declared attacker via `CombatState::is_attacking`) to `target_matches_filter` + the exhaustive
  `count_filter_matches`; real-turn test fires the trigger on `AttackersDeclared` and gates on the intervening-if.
  • **Treasure token def** (a token with an ACTIVATED `{T},Sac: any-color mana` ability —
  verify token activated abilities fire; S11 did only TRIGGERED token abilities) → **Seize the Spoils** (`khm`).
- **directed-discard `Effect`** (reveal hand → chooser picks → discard) → **Render Speechless**. • **Slumbering
  Trudge**: stun-counter core authorable now; its enter-tapped-if-X≤2 clause needs X threaded into `EntersTapped
  Unless`'s condition eval (whiteboard.rs ~1454 evals with no X ctx) — or defer that one clause.
- ~~**DistinctNamedLands value** → Emil~~ **DONE (sos-cards-7)** — `ValueExpr::DistinctNames{zone,filter,controller}`
  (distinct card-names among matching objects) + wired `CardFilter::HasCounter` into the layer-system static-scope
  matcher (`chars/mod.rs::matches_filter`) for Emil's "creatures you control with +1/+1 counters have trample" anthem.

Bigger subsystems stay DEFERRED (lower ROI, per the milestone call): **spell-copy** (~5 cards but 4 double-blocked
→ ~1 net; a full stack-copy subsystem — NOT worth first-pass), move-counters, conditional cost-reduction (S12),
dynamic-ManaValue, blink-with-delayed-return, graveyard-play/recursion, grant-arbitrary-ability, **Fractalize**
(= milestone-5 SET color/type layers, out of first-pass scope), LKI dies-triggers, Natives. 36 prepare-DFC + 2
planeswalkers + 5 Lessons stay deferred by type.

**PROCESS (unchanged, hard-won):** shared tree → `git commit --only <paths>`, never `-a`/`add -A`/stash; don't
touch `experiments/`; `cargo test -p mtg-core` green at every commit; flip a cap's ledger Status cell in the SAME
commit; **`git log -S "<mechanism>"` before scoping any ⏳ row as new**; **READ THE CODE, don't trust the ledger's
prose** (three wrong "unbuilt" beliefs were overturned this session by checking — first-strike, lifelink earlier,
"mined-out"). Ping the lead at cap boundaries. On fatigue: declare, rewrite THIS block, hand off clean.

---
**Older handoff (sos-cards-5, superseded by the block above — kept for provenance):** Shipped **11 cards,
3 caps, 2 engine fixes; 536 mtg-core tests green; tree clean, all pushed.** Caps: **S17 Ward** (`96dbc35` —
`Effect::CounterUnlessPay` soft-counter + `EffectTarget::Triggering`, threaded via `GameEvent::Targeted.source`
→ `state.trigger_targeting_source` → `ResolutionCtx.triggering_stack`; mana + discard cost paths; `CardFilter::
ItSelf` now matches in `enter_filter_matches`); **S10 flashback FRONT-cap** `Condition::CastFromNotHand`
(`8ed83b1`). Engine fixes: `Effect::MoveZone` was missing from `collect_specs_into` (reanimation/return targets
never collected through the real cast/trigger path); `CreateToken` now flushes at the deferred→imperative
boundary (#61) so "create tokens then affect them" works. Cards: 5 Ward (Colorstorm Stallion, Forum Necroscribe,
Tragedy Feaster, Thornfist Striker, Inkshape Demonstrator), Antiquities on the Loose, Rancorous Archaic,
Aberrant Manawurm, Topiary Lecturer, Hardened Academic (+ Ancestral Anger was already in `vow/`).

**Two lessons that saved/cost time — apply them:** (1) **`git log -S "<mechanism>"` before scoping any ⏳ cap
as new work** — 6 rows had drifted stale (S2/S3/S7/S10/S11/S18 were all done); a full audit reconciled them and
a PROCESS RULE is now in the capability-ledger header (flip the Status cell in the SAME commit as the cap).
(2) **Verify keyword/subsystem wiring by READING the code, not from memory** — "lifelink not combat-wired" was
believed by two sources but `apply_damage` already gains life (CR 702.15) and reads the COMPUTED keyword set, so
even a granted lifelink works; that unblocked 2 cards. ⚠️ **CORRECTION (agent 6, 2026-07-03):** the claim that
"double-strike / first-strike ARE genuinely unwired" was ALSO WRONG (same read-the-code lesson) — `combat/mod.rs::
combat_damage` has had the CR 510.4 two-substep split since `a15015f`; tests `double_strike_deals_twice` +
`first_strike_kills_before_retaliation` prove it, and `deals_in` reads the COMPUTED keyword set so granted FS/DS
works. **Both keywords are DONE.** Queue item #1 below was a no-op; it's struck.

**State of the pool: the no-cap / easy-card vein is MINED OUT.** Every remaining unauthored non-DFC card needs a
genuinely-new cap (see the fresh cap queue below). The big deferred bucket is 36 modal-DFC + Lesson/planeswalker/
named-keyword cards (out of first-pass scope per CLAUDE.md).

Tree clean, **509 mtg-core tests green**, all pushed. This session (sos-cards-4) shipped **5 cards + 4 caps**,
all with tests incl. real-turn-engine integration tests where a trigger fires. Handing off at a natural
boundary (still green — the small/clean caps are largely picked; what remains is heavier). What landed:
- **Multi-target MoveZone** (`12c41f8`, E1 extension) → **Pull from the Grave**. `chosen_targets` is a FLAT
  `Vec<Target>`; a `max>1` slot flattens all picks into it, so the MoveZone arm loops up to `spec.max`.
  **Invariant (in the arm):** a `max>1` slot must be the spell's LAST targeting sub-effect.
- **Source-threaded `Not(ItSelf)`** (`1f6e284`) → **Ascendant Dustspeaker**. `target_candidates` /
  `target_matches_filter` now take `source: Option<ObjId>` + a `CardFilter::ItSelf` arm → "another target"
  excludes the source at the *targeting* layer (not just resolution).
- **S21 cast-with-{X} trigger** (`134444d`, `HasXInCost` in `enter_filter_matches`) → **Matterbending Mage**.
- **`CreateToken.dynamic_counters`** (`9d2a856`) → **Wild Hypothesis** + **Snarl Song** (Snarl Song was FREE:
  cap + S7 `ColorsSpent`). The Quandrix "0/0 Fractal → X/X" pattern; reusable.

**Fresh cap queue (all GENUINELY-NEW — verified unbuilt 2026-07-03; each: one cap, one+ card, one commit, a
real-path test; flip the ledger Status cell in the SAME commit).** Ordered by realistic yield/effort:

1. ~~**First-strike / double-strike combat wiring**~~ — **ALREADY DONE** (agent 6, `a15015f`). The CR 510.4
   two-substep split is in `combat/mod.rs::combat_damage`; tests `double_strike_deals_twice` +
   `first_strike_kills_before_retaliation` prove it. **No card unblocked** — Practiced Offense still needs a modal
   keyword-pick + "counter on each creature target player controls" (target-player + ForEach), both still unbuilt.
2. ~~**Per-turn "counters put on THIS permanent this turn" tracker**~~ — **DONE** (agent 6). `Object.
   counter_added_this_turn` (set in the `AddCounters` executor for `n>0`; reset at turn start for all permanents +
   on zone change) + `Condition::PutCounterOnSelfThisTurn` (reads the source's flag). → **Fractal Tender** authored
   (6th of 8 Ward cards). Remaining Ward: Mica + Prismari (PayLife + spell-copy/storm).
3. **`pay_cost` `PayLife` arm** (tiny) + then Ward—Pay-life cards (**Mica**, **Prismari**) — BUT both are also
   blocked by spell-copy/storm secondaries, so PayLife alone yields 0 cards. Build it only alongside a consumer.
4. ~~**Apply-to-each-of-a-variable-multi-target**~~ — **DONE** (agent 6). New `Effect::ForEachTarget { slot, body }`:
   declares `slot` as a targeting spec at cast (added to `collect_specs_into`), then at resolution binds each chosen
   target to `EffectTarget::Each` in turn and runs `body` (reusing the `foreach_current` machinery — now generalized
   to `Option<Target>` so `Each` can be an object OR a player). → **Homesickness** (`{4}{U}{U}`:
   `TargetPlayer`+`Draw{ChosenTarget(0),2}` then `ForEachTarget` over up-to-2 creatures, `body = Tap{Each}+
   PutCounters{Each,Stun}`) and **Prismari Charm** mode 2 (1 damage to each of one or two "any" targets, incl.
   players). Reusable for any "do X to each of up-to-N targets."
5. **Spell-copy** (S14, ⏳ — token-copy already done). A real subsystem: mint a StackObject copy of a spell above
   the original (CR 707.10) + a "you may choose new targets" reselection. LOW practical yield — of its 7 cards,
   most are ALSO blocked elsewhere (Aziza tap-3 cost, Choreographed Sparks modal+creature-copy-grants, Mica
   Ward-pay-life, Prismari storm); alone it unblocks essentially only **Lumaret's Favor**. Build for the
   subsystem, not the count.
6. **Fractalize** (set-base-P/T + retype, layer work — do carefully). "Target creature *becomes* a green-and-blue
   Fractal, base P/T = X+1, loses all other colors and creature types" = SET/replace color+type layers (not
   Earthbend's ADD): new `StaticContribution::{SetColors,SetCreatureTypes}` + a one-shot `SetBasePT` on a target
   (the current `BecomeCreature` carries no P/T/color/type). Groundwork for other "becomes a Fractal" cards.

The DFC/Lesson/planeswalker/named-keyword bucket (~40 cards) stays DEFERRED per CLAUDE.md first-pass scope.

**Assessed-and-deferred (don't re-derive — the analysis is done):**
- **Mind into Matter** = **3 caps, not 1** (leave until a cheaper consumer): (a) dynamic-MV filter —
  `count_filter_matches` is EXHAUSTIVE and takes **no ctx**, so a `ManaValueAtMost(ValueExpr)` sibling filter
  (ValueExpr *is* Eq/Serialize → fits `CardFilter`) forces threading ctx through it + callers; (b) `MoveZone`
  from a `Select` (put a card from hand → battlefield; MoveZone only handles `Target` today); (c) enter-tapped
  (`ZoneDest`/MoveZone has no tapped flag).
- **Divergent Equation** = dynamic-X target count (`TargetSpec.max` fixed `u32`; needs max = chosen X).
- **Moment of Reckoning** = repeatable modal modes (choose same mode >1×, one target per instance).
- **Ennis** = ETB blink (exile + delayed return next end step) + exile-count-this-turn condition.
- **Tester of the Tangential** = pay-{X}-in-an-ability + a MoveCounters effect (move X counters between
  creatures) — `Not(ItSelf)` (done) covers only its "another target creature".
- **Fractal Anomaly DONE** (agent 6, `ValueExpr::CardsDrawnThisTurn`). **Emil** still needs a differently-named-lands
  value (a new DistinctNames ValueExpr) + Emil's {T} ability (the dynamic-counters cap is ready).

DEFERRED still (never build): DFC/modal, Lessons/Paradigm, planeswalkers, Casualty, Elder-Dragon grants;
dies-triggers need LKI (Arnyn, Cauldron of Essence).

**Blocked set (need an unbuilt cap first — don't burn time on these until the cap lands):**
- **Ward (S17, ◑ mana+discard built)** — Colorstorm Stallion + Forum Necroscribe + Tragedy Feaster + Thornfist
  Striker + Inkshape Demonstrator + **Fractal Tender** DONE (**6 of 8 cards**). ⚠️ **Lifelink IS combat-wired**
  (`apply_damage` gains the source's controller life = damage dealt, CR 702.15, and reads the COMPUTED keyword set
  so a GRANTED lifelink counts) — the earlier "lifelink not combat-wired" note (mine + the audit's) was WRONG; that
  unblocked Inkshape (Repartee grants lifelink) AND **Hardened Academic** (Discard→lifelink). **Fractal Tender**
  `{3}{G}{U}` used the new per-turn counter-added tracker (agent 6). Remaining 2 Ward cards: **Mica** & **Prismari**
  (pay_cost PayLife arm + spell-copy/storm). **Ward—Pay-life needs a `pay_cost` PayLife arm** (IR ready; no-op today).

**▶ Fresh authorable-now list (2026-07-03 unauthored-card audit — verified vs the real engine):** the audit
found `ConditionalStatic`, stun counters, `ValueExpr::{Sum,XTimes,NumTargets,PowerOfTarget}`, `CardFilter::
{Named,ManaValue,PowerAtMost}`, `Effect::{Fight,Distribute,BecomeCreature}` all LIVE. The audit's AUTHORABLE-NOW list is
**fully swept**: Antiquities/Rancorous/Aberrant/Topiary/Thornfist done, Ancestral Anger already in `vow/`. **Plus
2 cards the audit wrongly marked "lifelink-blocked"** — lifelink IS wired, so **Inkshape Demonstrator** (5th Ward
card) and **Hardened Academic** are done too. **Homesickness DONE** (agent 6, `Effect::ForEachTarget`).

⚠️ **CORRECTION (agent 6 audit, 2026-07-03): the "no-cap vein is mined out" claim was WRONG.** A fresh
unauthored-card audit (verified vs the interpreter) found **2 zero-cap cards** — **Prismari Charm** (3-mode modal,
DONE) and **Withering Curse** (all-creatures -2/-2 or Infusion destroy-all, DONE) — plus a live vein of
**one-small-cap** cards. Newly DONE by agent 6: **Geometer's Arthropod** (`XOfTriggeringSpell`). Still-cheap
1-cap wins the audit surfaced (each a single small leaf, some sharing a cap):
- ~~**S22 `Condition` "cast an instant/sorcery this turn"**~~ **DONE** (agent 6) — `Player.instants_sorceries_
  cast_this_turn` (counted in `cast_spell`, reset each turn) + `Condition::CastInstantOrSorceryThisTurn`; ALSO
  wired `Restriction::OnlyIf` into the activated-ability legality gate (was only honoured for mana abilities) +
  a reusable `artifact()` builder. → **Potioner's Trove** DONE. **Burrog Barrage** still needs care — its only
  target sits inside a `Conditional`, which `collect_specs_into` doesn't walk (targeting-collection wrinkle).
- ~~**"counters put on self" `EventPattern`**~~ **DONE** (agent 6) — `EventPattern::CountersPutOnSelf { kind }` +
  `GameEvent::CountersPut` broadcast from the `AddCounters` executor (once per counter-adding event, battlefield
  only). → **Pensive Professor** DONE (Increment→+1/+1→draw). **Berta, Wise Extrapolator** still needs its
  `{X},{T}`-activated Fractal ability + "add one mana of any color" trigger (check any-color `AddMana` + {X}-in-
  activated-cost threading before scoping).
- **S20 `ValueExpr::CountersOnTarget(n)`** → **Growth Curve**. • **`DistinctNamedLands` value** → **Emil**.
- **`CardFilter::Attacking`** → **Living History**. • **Treasure token def** → **Seize the Spoils**.
- **directed-discard `Effect`** → **Render Speechless**. • **Slumbering Trudge** (stun core authorable now;
  enter-tapped clause needs X threaded into the `EntersTappedUnless` condition eval, or defer that clause).
Bigger subsystems (lower ROI, deferred): spell-copy (~5 cards but most double-blocked), move-counters, cost-
reduction (S12), dynamic-ManaValue, blink-with-delayed-return, graveyard-play, grant-arbitrary-ability,
Fractalize (milestone-5 layers), LKI dies-triggers. Recommended next: the two shared 1-cap leaves (S22,
counters-put-on-self) clear 4 cards fast; spell-copy is NOT worth its subsystem cost for the first pass.
Genuinely-absent caps (from the audit): spell-copy, move-counters, counters-on-TARGET value, no-max-hand,
DYNAMIC ManaValue bounds, one-shot set-base-P/T on a target, self "costs less", grant-arbitrary-ability; DFC/
Lesson/planeswalker/named-keyword buckets remain deferred (36 DFC + more).
- **S16 end-step-token timing** — the begin-of-step-trigger cap unblocked the *timing*; any remaining
  end-step-token card is now authorable IF its other clauses are (check per-card).
- **S15 graveyard-play** — Ark of Hunger (mill → play from graveyard); needs a graveyard analog of
  `castable_from_exile` + a graveyard scan in the offer loop. Tablet of Discovery also needs it (+ S13, done).
- **Archaic's Agony** — S7+S15 unblocked but still needs an excess-damage value + multi-card top-of-library
  exile (`TopOfLibrary` is single-card).

Systemic: honour the proposed audit rule (⚠️/✅ trigger section) — every new `Triggered` should fire once
through the REAL turn engine in a test. SHARED TREE: `git commit --only <paths>`; MuZero teammate lives in
`experiments/`.

**Card data lives in the SQLite index, never memory** (CLAUDE.md "Card data"):
```
sqlite3 data/scryfall/cards.sqlite \
  "SELECT mana_cost,type_line,power,toughness,oracle_text,rarity
     FROM cards WHERE set_code='sos' AND name='<card>' ORDER BY released_at DESC LIMIT 1;"
```
Always re-read the oracle text from the db before authoring a card.

## Folder placement (first-printing rule)

Per repo convention a card lives in its **first-printing real-expansion** folder. For SoS that is
`sos/` for **255** of the 271 (the promo/prerelease codes `psos`/`pvow` collapse to `sos`/`vow`).
The genuine older reprints go elsewhere and **may already exist / should be reused, not duplicated**:

| Card | folder | note |
|---|---|---|
| Essence Scatter | `m10` | reprint |
| Last Gasp | `rav` | reprint |
| Quick Study | `woe` | reprint |
| Seize the Spoils | `khm` | reprint |
| Terramorphic Expanse | `tsp` | reprint (verify first-print at author time) |
| Ancestral Anger, Deathcap Glade, Dreamroot Cascade, Shattered Sanctum, Stormcarved Coast, Sundown Pass | `vow` | Crimson Vow reprints (6) |

`Erode` (`sos`) and the five basics (`misc`) are **already implemented** — reuse.

## Triage summary (2026-07-03)

271 distinct cards triaged against the **current** engine (Selesnya-push IR + Crew + Warp):

| Tier | Meaning | Count |
|---|---|---|
| **T1** | vanilla / french-vanilla (implemented keywords only) | **6** (5 basics done + Rearing Embermare) |
| **T2** | expressible in existing IR, **no new cap** | **68** |
| **T3** | needs one small card-agnostic cap (an S-cap below) | **142** |
| **T4** | needs a major subsystem — **deferred** | **55** (36 modal-DFC + 19 subsystem cards) |

The DFC bucket is deferred by CLAUDE.md first-pass scope ("double-faced / split … leave unbuilt").
So the reachable near-term pool is **T1 + T2 (74) then the T3 long tail (142)** as caps land.

## Capability ledger — small caps SoS needs (S-caps)

Card-agnostic caps to build in the Selesnya style (new `EventPattern` / `ValueExpr` / `Condition` /
`Effect` leaf / `Qualification` / `Rewrite` / `TokenSpec` field). Build **highest-leverage first**;
each cap unlocks the bracketed count. `⏳` = not yet built.

> ⚠️ **PROCESS RULE (learned the hard way — S7, S10, S2, S3, S18, S11 all drifted stale):** flip a cap's
> Status cell to ✅/◑ **in the SAME commit that lands the cap**, with the commit hash. Before scoping any
> "⏳" cap as new work, `git log -S "<mechanism/enum name>"` first — the row may already be done. A
> **2026-07-03 audit** re-verified every row against the codebase; genuinely-open caps are now only: S12
> (conditional cost-reduction — only the unconditional `CostReductionGeneric` static exists), S14 spell-copy
> (token-copy done, copy-target-spell not), S19/S20/S22, and most `misc one-offs` + `Native`.

| Cap | What it adds | Cards | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S1** Surveil N | look at top N, put any number in graveyard, rest back (CR 701.42) — `Effect::Surveil` | 15 | ✅ **DONE** `cc58a7b` |
| **S5** Opus | `SpellCast(I/S you control)` trigger + `ValueExpr::ManaSpentOnTrigger` + `≥5` condition | 13 | ✅ **DONE** `e85771e` |
| **S8** Repartee | `SpellCast(I/S you control **that targets a creature**)` trigger (inspect cast targets) | 12 | ✅ **DONE** |
| **S4** Infusion | per-turn per-player "gained life this turn" state + a `Condition` reading it | 12 | ✅ **DONE** `89b3581` |
| **S10** Flashback | alt-cast from graveyard for a flashback cost, then exile (Warp-analogue) | 11 | ✅ **DONE** (offer at priority.rs ~1075 `flashback_cost`/`CastVariant::Flashback`; exile-on-resolve ~1718; `Ability::Flashback{cost:ManaCost}`). **6 cards authored** (Dig Site Inventory, Duel Tactics, Molten Note, Pursue the Past, Tome Blast, **Antiquities on the Loose** `8ed83b1` — front-cap: `Condition::CastFromNotHand` reads the spell's `flashback_cast` flag; that commit ALSO fixed a #61 bug where `CreateToken` staged deferred so a later same-resolution step couldn't see the tokens — CreateToken now flushes/commits at the boundary, unblocking "create tokens then affect them"). ⚠️ **cost is mana-only** — a non-mana flashback cost (Group Project's "tap three creatures") is NOT expressible; a card that *grants* flashback (the card "Flashback") needs a dynamic-ability-grant cap. Remaining 4 front-cap cards: **Practiced Offense** (blocked — grants double-strike/lifelink, not combat-wired), **Daydream** (needs an exiled-card reference for its self-blink), **Group Project** (non-mana flashback cost), **Flashback** (dynamic ability grant). |
| **S6** Increment | `SpellCast(you)` trigger + condition "mana spent > this creature's power OR toughness" | 9 | ✅ **DONE** |
| **S7** Converge | `ValueExpr::ColorsOfManaSpent` (ETB counters / X in Converge spells) | 9 | ✅ **DONE** `ba8c183` (`ValueExpr::ColorsSpent` — `Object.colors_spent` recorded at cast; consumers Arcane Omens, Together as One, Magmablood/Transcendent/Wildgrowth Archaic) |
| **S9** Graveyard-leave | "cards leave your graveyard" trigger + "a card left your graveyard this turn" cond | 8 | ✅ **DONE** (flag `f9b5584` + trigger: LeftGraveyard event snapshot in resolve_effect → Spirit Mascot, Owlin Historian, Garrison Excavator) |
| **S2** Look-and-pick | look at top N, put one/some in hand, rest on bottom (impulse selection) | 8 | ✅ **DONE** (`Effect::LookAndPick{ count, take, take_to, rest_to, take_filter }` — implemented; consumers Flow State, Stress Dream, Stirring Honormancer, Paradox Surveyor, Follow the Lumarets, Visionary's Dance). The ledger previously mis-listed this as ⏳. Geometer's Arthropod still needs "top-X" = reading the *triggering spell's* X (a separate need). |
| **S12** Cost-reduction cond. | "costs {N} less if it targets X / you control Y / a card left your gy" (cast-time) | 7 | ◑ **PIPELINE + STATE + TARGET-DEPENDENT DONE** (sos-cards-8 `9621fef` pipeline; sos-cards-9 target-dependent) — `Ability::CostReduction{amount:CostReductionAmount::{Generic\|GenericValue\|Cost}, condition:CostReductionCondition::{State(Condition)\|TargetMatches(CardFilter)}}` + `effective_cast_cost(p,card,base,TargetCtx::{Optimistic\|Chosen(&targets)})`. **State** cond → **Orysa**. **Target-dependent** (CR 601.2f, sos-cards-9): the offer gate applies the discount optimistically (a legal matching target exists → best-case cost), `cast_spell` recomputes the FINAL cost from the CHOSEN targets *and* constrains each target slot's candidates to what the caster can pay (reductions only lower cost → base affordable keeps all; else only discount-granting targets), so auto_pay never underpays — **no rewind** (the load-bearing invariant agent-8 flagged). + `CardFilter::Tapped`/`Untapped` arms. → **Ajani's Response** (Destroy + {3}-off-if-targets-tapped; real-cast test proves the untapped creature is NOT offered when only {1}{W} is affordable). **Remaining:** **Brush Off** (Counter + {1}{U} coloured + targets-an-I/S-*spell*) — *also* needs `TargetKind::StackObject` candidate enumeration in the real cast path (`target_candidates` returns empty for StackObject; counterspells are only tested via `resolve_effect`) + stack-target filter matching; **Run Behind** (uses this cap; needs a "put on top/bottom of library, owner's choice" effect); **Diary of Dreams** = activated-ability cost reduction (per-ability variant); **The Dawning Archaic** = `GenericValue(Count{I/S in gy})` [arm built, untested] + free-cast-on-attack trigger; **Wilt in the Heat** = `State(CardLeftGraveyardThisTurn)` (free via the existing pipeline) + 5 dmg + exile-if-dies replacement rider. |
| **S14** Copy spell/perm | "copy target spell", "create a token that's a copy of" (heavier small-cap) | 7 | ◑ **token-copy DONE** (`Effect::CreateTokenCopy`+`TokenCopyMods`, `a8c8a2d` → Applied Geometry); **spell-copy** portion ⏳ — a real subsystem (copy a stack spell per CR 707.10: mint a new StackObject copy above the original + a "you may choose new targets" reselection). **Low practical yield (scoped 2026-07-03):** of the 7 spell-copy cards, most are ALSO blocked elsewhere — Aziza (tap-3-creatures cost), Choreographed Sparks (modal + creature-spell-copy-with-grants + "can't be copied"), Mica (Ward—Pay-life), Prismari (Storm + Elder Dragon). Spell-copy ALONE unblocks essentially only **Lumaret's Favor** (Infusion "copy it if you gained life this turn" + a +2/+4 pump). So build it for the subsystem, not the count. |
| **S17** Ward {cost} | Ward N / Ward—Pay life / Ward—Discard (counter-unless-pay on becoming targeted) | 7 | ◑ **mana DONE** `96dbc35` — `Effect::CounterUnlessPay{ what, cost:Cost }` soft-counter + `EffectTarget::Triggering` (the targeting spell/ability, threaded via `GameEvent::Targeted.source` → `state.trigger_targeting_source` → `ResolutionCtx.triggering_stack`); `CardFilter::ItSelf` now matches in `enter_filter_matches` (source-threaded, opt-in from the targeted path). Reuses `Cost`+`can_pay_cost`/`pay_cost`. Ward constructors live in `cards/helpers.rs` (`ward`/`ward_mana`/`ward_discard`). → **Colorstorm Stallion** (Ward {1}, mana) + **Forum Necroscribe** (Ward—Discard, the non-mana path — reuses the `Discard` cost arms). **Ward—Pay life** (Mica/Prismari): `pay_cost` has NO `PayLife` arm yet (falls to `_ => {}`, so life isn't deducted) — add it first; their *secondaries* are also blocked (spell-copy/storm). Side-fix landed here: `Effect::MoveZone`'s target was missing from `collect_specs_into` (never collected through the REAL cast/trigger path — prior MoveZone tests bypassed casting), now fixed. |
| **S15** Impulse play | exile/mill → "you may play it until end of turn / your next turn" | 6 | ◑ **DONE for exile cases** (`d079eb0` base + `0e17d3e` top-of-library source + land-play) → Practiced Scrollsmith, Elemental Mascot, Suspend Aggression (3). Only **graveyard-play** (milled card played from gy — Ark of Hunger, Tablet) still ⏳; the other 2 S15 cards are cap-blocked (Archaic's Agony=S7, Tablet=S13) |
| **S3** Stun counters | `CounterKind::Stun` + "would untap → remove a stun counter instead" replacement | 6 | ✅ **DONE** `f8ab8ea` (untap-step replacement, CR 702.171) → Procrastinate, Deluge Virtuoso, Fractal Mascot, Rapier Wit. (Was mis-listed ⏳.) |
| **S18** Graveyard-activated | an ability that functions while its card is in the graveyard (recursion) | 6 | ✅ **DONE** `6190bb2` (`CostComponent::ExileSelfFromGraveyard` + graveyard ability enumeration in `legal_priority_actions`) → Eternal Student, Stone Docent. Also `DiscardSelfFromHand` for hand-usable cycling-style abilities (Visionary's Dance). (Was mis-listed ⏳.) |
| **S11** Token-with-ability | `TokenSpec` carries an ability (Treasure `{T},Sac`; Pest attack→gain life) | 5 | ◑ **DONE for grp-id ability tokens** — a `TokenSpec.grp_id` points at a registered token def whose abilities fire (Pest `PEST_TOKEN`=9001, "attack → gain 1 life") → Send in the Pest, Pestbrood Sloth, Essenceknit Scholar. A **Treasure** token (`{T}, Sac: add one mana of any color` — an ACTIVATED mana ability on a token) is not yet verified; check for a registered Treasure def before authoring one. (Was mis-listed ⏳.) |
| **S13** Restricted mana | mana usable "only to cast instant and sorcery spells" (spend-restriction tag) | 4 | ✅ **DONE** `ffcc0df` (`ManaSpec.restriction=InstantSorceryOnly` + `ManaPool.restricted` bucket + `allow_restricted` threaded through the payment path; spell casts pass card-is-I/S, ability costs pass false) → Hydro-Channeler |
| **S16** Gain-life trigger | `EventPattern::GainLife` ("whenever you gain life, …") | 3 | ✅ **DONE** |
| **S21** cast-with-{X} trigger | `SpellCast` filtered to "has {X} in its cost" | 2 | ✅ **DONE** (`134444d` + agent 6) — `HasXInCost` arm in `enter_filter_matches` → **Matterbending Mage**; `ValueExpr::XOfTriggeringSpell` (reads the triggering spell's `Object.cast_x`, recorded at cast alongside `mana_spent`) → **Geometer's Arthropod** (look at top X, keep 1). |
| **S19** cards-drawn-this-turn value | `ValueExpr::CardsDrawnThisTurn` (reads `Player.cards_drawn_this_turn`, reset each turn + incremented in `draw`) | 1 | ✅ **DONE** (agent 6) → **Fractal Anomaly** (0/0 Fractal + X counters, X = cards drawn this turn) |
| **{X}-in-activated-cost** | choose `{X}` when activating an ability (CR 602.2b), fold into mana paid, carry on the stack object so `ValueExpr::X` reads it at resolution — mirrors the spell-cast X path | 1 | ✅ **DONE** (sos-cards-7) — `activate_ability` (priority.rs) `ChooseNumber{ChooseX}` bounded by affordable mana + folds `chosen_x * pips` into generic; ability-resolution `ResolutionCtx.x` was `None`, now `obj.x`. → **Berta, Wise Extrapolator** (`{X},{T}: Fractal with X counters`). NOTE: Emil's `{4}{G},{T}` does NOT use a paid `{X}` — its X = differently-named lands (needs a `DistinctNamedLands` value, a separate cap). |
| **S20** counters-on-target value | `ValueExpr::CountersOnTarget { target, kind }` (reads live count of a counter kind on the Nth chosen target) + a flush-before-`PutCounters` interpret arm so a prior counter-add commits before the read | 1 | ✅ **DONE** (sos-cards-7) → **Growth Curve** ("+1/+1 counter, then double"). The flush mirrors CreateToken's #61 fix; the full suite (568 tests) confirms no counter-card regression. |
| **S22** cast-I/S-this-turn cond | (done — see NEXT-AGENT block) | 1 | ✅ **DONE** (agent 6) |
| **misc one-offs** | GreatestMV, ~~DistinctNames~~, ~~SoftCounter~~, ~~DirectedDiscard~~, AltCost, PayXLife, NoMaxHand, GrantAbility | 1–3 ea | ⏳ except **SoftCounter ✅** (`Effect::CounterUnlessPay`, Ward `96dbc35`), **DistinctNames ✅** (sos-cards-7, `ValueExpr::DistinctNames`), and **DirectedDiscard ✅ DONE** (sos-cards-8 `4faa6d9` — `Effect::DirectedDiscard{who,chooser,count,filter}` chooser≠discarder + `TargetKind::Player(PlayerFilter::{Any,Opponent,You})` general player-target restriction → **Render Speechless**). The rest (GreatestMV/AltCost/PayXLife/NoMaxHand/GrantAbility) genuinely unbuilt. |
| **LKI dies-triggers** | last-known-info store (CR 603.10a) + `CreatureDies(filter)` wiring so other permanents' filtered dies-triggers fire, matched against the dead object's pre-death chars/controller | 2+ | ✅ **DONE** (sos-cards-8 `3ef761d`) — `GameState.last_known` captured in `move_object`, `queue_watching_dies_triggers`/`dies_filter_matches`, `CardFilter::ToughnessAtMost` → **Arnyn, Cauldron of Essence**. LKI store is groundwork for ALL future dies/LTB abilities (effect-time LKI reads still TODO). |
| **graveyard-recursion** | `CostComponent::ActivateFromGraveyard` (pure gy-usability marker, no cost effect — cf. S18's `ExileSelfFromGraveyard`) for "{cost}: return this from your graveyard" self-recursion | 3+ | ◑ **self→hand + self→battlefield-tapped DONE** — `4b70bc1` (self→hand) → **Summoned Dromedary**; sos-cards-9 (self→battlefield TAPPED, via the new **enters-tapped** cap below) → **Teacher's Pest** (completes the trio's tapped-reanimation). **Postmortem Professor** DONE (sos-cards-9): self `Qualification::CantBlock` static + `SelfAttacks` drain (`Sequence[LoseLife EachOpponent, GainLife]`) + graveyard-recursion whose cost exiles *another* I/S card from the gy via the newly-wired **`CostComponent::Exile`** (see below). **Killian's Confidence** DONE (sos-cards-9): the new-class **graveyard-functioning triggered abilities** cap (see below). ✅ **The whole graveyard-recursion vein is now cleared.** |
| **enters-tapped (MoveZone)** | `tapped: bool` on `Effect::MoveZone` + `Action::MoveZone` (set in the executor after `move_object` re-untaps, CR 110.5 — the `Effect::Search { tapped }` analogue for reanimation/bounce-to-battlefield) | 3 | ✅ **DONE** (sos-cards-9) → **Teacher's Pest** (gy→battlefield tapped). Also registered the **Swamp** basic land (`grp::SWAMP=5` — was missing; no black mana source existed). Now unblocks the enters-tapped *clause* of **Mind Roots** (discard 2, put a discarded land tapped) + **Mind into Matter** (put a permanent from hand tapped) — each still needs its OTHER clauses (Mind Roots = put-from-hand/discard-driven; Mind into Matter = draw-X + put-from-hand + dynamic-MV). |
| **Exile-as-cost** | `CostComponent::Exile(SelectSpec)` wired in `can_pay_cost`/`pay_cost` (`exile_cost_candidates`/`pay_exile_cost`, mirror the Discard pair; excludes the source; moves chosen cards to Exile) — was defined-but-unpaid ("for escape/delve"). | 1+ | ✅ **DONE** (sos-cards-9) → **Postmortem Professor** ("Exile an I/S card from your graveyard:"). Reusable for future escape/delve. |
| **graveyard-functioning triggers** | `Ability::FunctionsFrom(Vec<Zone>)` marker (CR 113.6 — battlefield is the implicit default zone-of-function; only deviating cards carry the marker, zero churn) + `collect_triggers` graveyard scan (`queue_graveyard_functioning_triggers`, reuses `queue_self_triggers`) + batched `EventPattern::YouDealCombatDamageToPlayer` / `GameEvent::CombatDamageToPlayerBy` (once per controller per combat-damage step, broadcast from `deal_combat_substep`) + `Effect::MayPayCost{cost,then}` ("you may pay …; if you do, …" — the mana analogue of `IfYouDo`). | 1+ | ✅ **DONE** (sos-cards-9) → **Killian's Confidence**. `FunctionsFrom` generalizes to hand/exile (madness/suspend) by adding zones to the scan; `MayPayCost` is broadly reusable. |
| **Native** | genuine one-offs via the `Native` escape hatch: Mathemagics (2^X), Pox Plague (halving), Steal the Show (wheel) | 4 | ⏳ |

Building **S1, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S10** (the seven big-count caps) converts ~**79** T3 cards to authorable.

## ✅ Trigger-system gap — **found + FIXED 2026-07-03** (`20965a8`)

**RESOLVED.** Both gaps below are fixed: `collect_triggers` now queues each permanent's
`BeginningOfStep(phase)` trigger at phase transitions (`queue_begin_of_step_triggers`); a
non-intervening-if trigger condition (CR 603.2) gates queueing, and an intervening-if (CR 603.4) is
re-checked at put-on-stack + resolution (`trigger_intervening_if_holds`). Scoped to condition-bearing
triggers, so `condition: None` triggers are unaffected. **Turn-engine integration tests prove the 4
revived cards now fire (and gate correctly): Startled Relic Sloth, Essenceknit Scholar, Primary
Research, Additive Evolution** — all four are now genuinely `fully_implemented` (flags never lied
across a session boundary). Ennis (unimplemented) will benefit when authored.

_Original finding (kept for the record):_ tracing Abstract Paintmage's "at the beginning of your first
main phase" trigger surfaced **two real, pre-existing gaps** in the triggered-ability system:

1. **`EventPattern::BeginningOfStep(phase)` permanent triggers are never queued.** `collect_triggers`
   (priority.rs ~2718) handles `PhaseBegan` only for `Phase::End` *delayed* triggers (warp exile); there
   is **no scan that queues a permanent's `BeginningOfStep(phase)` trigger** at a phase transition
   (`queue_self_triggers` is called only for SelfEnters/SelfDies/GainLife/SelfAttacks; zero
   `BeginningOfStep` refs in priority.rs). So any "at the beginning of [your] [upkeep/main/combat/end
   step]" permanent trigger **does not fire through the real turn engine.**
2. **A `Triggered` ability's `condition` field is never evaluated.** Neither `put_trigger_on_stack`
   (~2487) nor `resolve_top`'s ability arm (~2233) reads `condition`/`intervening_if` for a normal
   (non-reflexive) trigger — it extracts `effect` and resolves it unconditionally. So a
   `condition: Some(YourTurn)`-style gate on a triggered ability is silently ignored.

_Impact was:_ Essenceknit Scholar (end-step draw), Startled Relic Sloth (begin-combat exile), Primary
Research (end-step draw), Additive Evolution (begin-combat pump) — all fixed + integration-tested.
Abstract Paintmage / Fractal Tender / S16 end-step-token timing are now **unblocked** (Abstract Paintmage
needs only its first-main-phase trigger authored — the queue + `add_mana`-to-restricted-bucket are wired).

**➕ Proposed systemic audit rule (for a future #60-style pass):** _every `Triggered` ability in the pool
should fire at least once through the REAL turn engine in some test_ (broadcast the event → `run_agenda` →
`resolve_top`), not only via `resolve_effect`-direct. This class of "silently-inert" bug (unqueued
triggers, ignored conditions) is invisible to resolve_effect-direct tests. The 4 integration tests added
here are the seed. The Selesnya pool got this audit (see SELESNYA_LANDFALL_CARDS.md #60); SOS deserves it.

## Engine reality-check — unimplemented effect leaves (E-caps) — **found during Phase 2**

The Phase-1 rubric assumed several `Effect` variants were interpreted; grepping the whiteboard
interpreter (`whiteboard.rs`) shows **six IR leaves are defined but interpreted nowhere** — a card
using one silently no-ops. So the true near-term T2 pool is **smaller than the 68 tallied above**:
some of those cards actually need one of these leaves wired first. These are the highest-leverage
caps (each is a small, card-agnostic interpreter arm lowering to an already-existing `Action`).

| E-cap | Effect leaf | Blocks (examples) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **E1** | `Effect::MoveZone` (bounce / return-to-hand / reanimate) | Zealous Lorecaster, Banishing Betrayal, Proctor's Gaze, Prismari Charm, Matterbending Mage, Pull from the Grave, Moment of Reckoning, Lorehold Charm | ✅ **DONE** `0e85b76` single-target + `12c41f8` multi-target fixed-max ("up to two" → Pull from the Grave). Dynamic-X-count (Divergent Equation) + repeatable-modal (Moment of Reckoning) still need their own caps. |
| **E2** | `Effect::Counter` (counter target spell), respecting `CantBeCountered` | Essence Scatter, Brush Off, Mana Sculpt, Quandrix Charm | ✅ **DONE** `eb2b364` (+ stack-zone static gathering; closed Surrak's deferral) |
| **E3** | `Effect::Discard` (loot "then discard a card"; "target player discards") | Traumatic Critique, Stadium Tidalmage, Charging Strifeknight, Rubble Rouser, Colossus, Rapturous Moment, Borrowed Knowledge, Send in the Pest | ✅ **DONE** `506baf9` |
| **E4** | `Effect::Sacrifice` (as an effect — "each player sacrifices", "sacrifice two lands") | Planar Engineering, Witherbloom Charm, Social Snub (needs S14 copy too), Pox Plague | ✅ **DONE** `b5ea234` (per-player: Controller / EachPlayer / EachOpponent) |
| **E5** | `Effect::Repeat` | (few) | ⏳ |
| **E6** | `Effect::Distribute` | (few) | ⏳ |

**Loud guard (`8604b34`):** `materialize()` is now an **exhaustive** match — a defined-but-unwired
`Effect` leaf `debug_assert!`s loudly in debug/tests instead of silently no-oping (the bug class that
hid Traumatic Critique's discard), and a NEW IR variant with no arm is a *compile* error. The only
remaining loud-assert leaves are E5 `Repeat`, E6 `Distribute`, and `Native` (no runtime yet).

**Wired today (safe for T2 authoring):** DealDamage, Draw, Destroy, Exile, GainLife, LoseLife, PumpPT,
GrantKeyword, GrantQualification, BecomeCreature, AddMana, PutCounters, CreateToken, Fight, Search,
Tap, Modal, Optional, IfYouDo, ForEach, Conditional, Earthbend, **MoveZone, Discard, Counter (new)**.

Next-highest leverage: **E4 Sacrifice** (each-player-sacrifices / sac-as-effect), then the S-caps
(S1 Surveil, S4 Infusion, S5 Opus, …).

(Deep T2 bench also ready: Dissection Practice, Traumatic Critique, Sneering Shadewriter,
Environmental Scientist, Harsh Annotation, Vibrant Outburst, Masterful Flourish, Shopkeeper's Bane.)

## 10 hardest (all T4 — deferred; here for the record)

1. **Prismari, the Inspiration** — Elder Dragon; grants **Storm** to all your I/S spells.
2. **Quandrix, the Proof** — Elder Dragon; has **Cascade** and grants it to your I/S.
3. **Lorehold, the Historian** — Elder Dragon; grants **Miracle {2}** to I/S in hand.
4. **Silverquill, the Disputant** — Elder Dragon; your I/S have **Casualty 1**.
5. **Witherbloom, the Balancer** — Elder Dragon; **Affinity for creatures** + grants it (dynamic cost).
6. **Professor Dellian Fel** — planeswalker; 4 loyalty abilities + emblem (whole PW subsystem).
7. **Ral Zarek, Guest Lecturer** — planeswalker; −7 "flip five coins, skip X turns".
8. **Restoration Seminar** (+ the 4 other Lessons) — **Paradigm**: exile & recast a free copy each main phase.
9. **Nita, Forum Conciliator** — cast spells you don't own + exile-and-cast opponents' graveyard spells.
10. **Petrified Hamlet** — ETB choose a card name, then name-scoped static grants/restrictions.

## Authoring plan

1. **T1/T2 sweep** — the 68 T2 + Rearing Embermare need no engine work; author them first (each: data
   IR + expect-test snapshot + a behaviour test for any effect; honest `fully_implemented`). This is
   the bulk of the immediately-shippable pool.
2. **Cap-then-cards** — build S-caps highest-leverage first (S1 Surveil, then S4/S5/S6/S7/S8/S10), each
   its own commit in the card-agnostic style (new IR node + tests), then author the T3 cards that cap
   unlocks. Keep `cargo test -p mtg-core` green at every commit.
3. **Defer T4** — mark deferred here, do not build. If a T3 card has one deferrable clause beyond its
   cap, ship the core with a documented `// deferred:` note (the established Humility/Rancor pattern).
4. A `sos_limited` preset deck once enough of the pool is playable.

## S10 Flashback — scoped implementation plan (warp-mirror)

Flashback is structurally the **warp** mechanic (alt-cost cast from a non-hand zone + a zone change
when it resolves). Mirror warp site-for-site:

1. `effects/ability.rs`: add `Ability::Flashback { cost: ManaCost }` (like `Ability::Warp`) and
   `CastVariant::Flashback`.
2. `state/mod.rs`: add `Object.flashback_cast: bool` (mirror `warp_cast`); reset it in `move_object`
   (CR 400.7) alongside `warp_cast`.
3. `priority.rs`:
   - `flashback_cost(card)` helper (mirror `warp_cost`, reads `Ability::Flashback`).
   - `legal_priority_actions` (~958): offer `CastVariant::Flashback` for cards **in the graveyard**
     whose def has `Ability::Flashback`, at the card's normal timing (sorcery→sorcery-speed,
     instant→instant-speed). Mirror the warp-from-hand block (~1009) but source = `Zone::Graveyard`.
   - `cost_for_variant` (~1489): `CastVariant::Flashback => self.flashback_cost(card)`.
   - source-zone removal (~1655): allow `Zone::Graveyard` for a flashback cast.
   - set `o.flashback_cast = true` at cast (mirror warp_cast flag ~1508).
   - `resolve_top` (~1928/1992): if `flashback_cast`, move the card to **Exile** instead of graveyard
     (CR 702.34 — "instead of putting it anywhere else, exile it"). This is the one place flashback
     *differs* from warp (warp arms an end-step exile; flashback exiles immediately on resolution).
4. Cards: Daydream, Antiquities on the Loose, Dig Site Inventory, Duel Tactics, Practiced Offense,
   Flashback (the card), etc. — each declares `Ability::Flashback { cost }` + its normal spell effect.

Test: cast a sorcery from graveyard via Flashback → effect resolves → card is in Exile (not graveyard);
and it's no longer offered for a second flashback.

## S11 token-with-ability — ✅ DONE (`bf22f6b`, synthetic token defs)

**Decision (lead-approved):** `TokenSpec.grp_id` (0 = vanilla) + pre-registered token defs in the reserved
**9000+** block (`grp::PEST_TOKEN = 9001`). Rationale: keeps token abilities in *defs* (card-agnostic
law — no name-match), mirrors how MTGA ids tokens, and the reserved block sits far above organically
growing real-card ids (~290) so no collision. **Confirmed** the `/api/cards` catalog filters
`!supertypes.contains(Token)` (server.rs:500), so the Pest def does **not** leak into the deck-builder;
token defs still flow into the art manifest (intended — tokens get art). `SelfAttacks` already fires,
so the Pest's attack-trigger works via `def_of`. Shipped: Send in the Pest, Pestbrood Sloth (Essenceknit
Scholar / Moseo defer — creature-died-this-turn / Infusion-X-reanimate clauses).

### original plan (kept for reference)

Problem: a token's ability lookup is `def_of(id)` → `CardDb.get(chars.grp_id)`; there is no
object-level ability storage, and the db is `Arc<CardDb>`. Keywords already ride on
`TokenSpec.keywords`; only *triggered/activated* token abilities (the Pest dies-trigger) need this.

Approach — give ability-bearing tokens a real `grp_id` pointing at a pre-registered def:
1. `effects/target.rs`: add `grp_id: u32` to `TokenSpec` (no `Default` derive, so **update all 8
   existing `TokenSpec {…}` literals** in `cards/helpers.rs` with `grp_id: 0` — vanilla/keyword-only
   tokens). Bump the `TokenSpec` serde/expect snapshots.
2. `whiteboard.rs` `create_token`: set `chars.grp_id = spec.grp_id;` (0 → no def, as today).
3. `cards/`: pre-register the **Pest token def** (`{}` 1/1 B/G Pest, `Triggered{SelfEnters? no —
   SelfDies, GainLife 1}`) in `starter_db` under a reserved id (e.g. `grp::PEST_TOKEN = 90001`), and
   set `helpers::pest_token().grp_id = PEST_TOKEN`. `SelfDies` is already wired (priority.rs 2539), so
   the trigger fires once the token carries the ability via `def_of`.
4. Cards (4): Send in the Pest, Essenceknit Scholar, Moseo (Vein's New Dean), Pestbrood Sloth.

Test: create a Pest token, kill it (SBA), assert its controller gained 1 life (the dies-trigger fired
through the synthetic def).

## S14 token-copy — ✅ DONE (`a8c8a2d`)
`Effect::CreateTokenCopy { source: EffectTarget, controller, mods: TokenCopyMods }` — the materialize
arm snapshots the source's **copiable** characteristics (its base `chars`: name/types/subtypes/colors/
P·T + abilities via the copied `grp_id`; **not** counters/damage/auras/other continuous effects, CR
707.2) into a `TokenSpec`, applies the `mods` CR 707.9e "except" overrides (`add_card_types` /
`add_subtypes` / `set_power_toughness` / `counters`), then reuses the existing `create_token` path.
`collect_specs_into` gained a `CreateTokenCopy{ source: Target }` arm so the copy target is enumerated
at cast. → **Applied Geometry** (copy a permanent as a 0/0 Fractal + six +1/+1 → a 6/6).
**Deferred token-copy consumers:** Colorstorm Stallion (also needs S17 Ward — build with Ward, uses the
SourceSelf/empty-`mods` copy-self path), Echocasting Symposium (Paradigm, T4). The **spell-copy** half
of S14 ("copy target/that spell" → a copy on the stack — Aziza, Choreographed Sparks, Mica, Social Snub,
Lumaret's Favor) is a **different mechanic** (stack object, not a battlefield token) and is still ⏳.

## Hybrid mana — the next high-value blocker (7 non-DFC cards)

`ManaCost` has no hybrid `{X/Y}` pip. This blocks 7 non-DFC SoS cards (Essenceknit Scholar,
Stirring Honormancer, Moseo, Abstract Paintmage, …) AND their riders. Scope:
- `basics::ManaCost`: add a hybrid-pip representation (e.g. `hybrid: Vec<(Color, Color)>`, each payable
  by either colour; keep `colored`/`generic` as-is).
- `mana::select_payment`: when planning, satisfy each hybrid pip with whichever of its two colours the
  player can produce (try both). `mana_value` counts each hybrid pip as 1.
- Card builders: extend `mana_cost` (or add `mana_cost_hybrid`) to author `{B/G}` etc.
Note: the **"creature died under your control this turn" flag** was scoped + reverted (only consumer,
Essenceknit Scholar, is hybrid-blocked) — rebuild it *with* Essenceknit once hybrid mana lands. Pattern
mirrors `cards_left_graveyard_this_turn`: Player counter, increment in the CreatureDies SBA (by the
creature's controller at death), reset in begin_turn, `Condition::CreatureDiedThisTurn`.

## Remaining cap queue (all engine files released; pick by fresh-context fit)
- **Hybrid mana** (above) — 7 cards, payment-planner change.
- **S7 Converge** — track *colors* of mana spent at cast (extend `auto_pay` to report spent colours →
  record `Object.colors_spent` → `ValueExpr::ColorsOfManaSpent`). ~8 Archaic-cycle cards.
- **S18 graveyard-activated** — activate an ability from the graveyard (discard/exile cost); extend the
  activated-ability enumeration to scan the graveyard for a graveyard-source ability.
- **S9-trigger** (graveyard-leave event), **CreatureDies trigger** (needs LKI), **S14 token-copy**
  (extends S11 — copy the target's `grp_id`+chars onto the token).

## Precedent: revert-rather-than-ship-unused-cap
When a scoped cap's *only* consumer turns out to be blocked by a different missing feature, **revert the
cap** rather than ship engine infra (a field / Condition / ValueExpr) with no card exercising it. Ship
caps only with a card that lands them. (Established when the "creature-died-this-turn" flag's only user,
Essenceknit Scholar, was found hybrid-mana-blocked — flag reverted, rebuild it *with* Essenceknit once
hybrid lands.)

## Hybrid mana — ✅ DONE (`8daf069`, `{X/Y}` two-colour pips)
`ManaCost.hybrid: Vec<(Color,Color)>` (serde-default) + `select_payment` satisfies each hybrid pip with
a unit of either colour (after fixed pips, before generic; shared by `can_pay`+`auto_pay`) + `mana_value`
counts each hybrid pip as 1 + `mana_cost_hybrid()` builder. **Wire:** gym `obs.rs` doesn't encode raw
ManaCost fields (transparent); the web client (`main.ts`) renders from `generic`/`colored` and ignores
`hybrid` → a hybrid card shows its pip incomplete but **does not crash** (graceful, per lead). Follow-up
(UI team): render `{X/Y}` pips in `main.ts`. → Stirring Honormancer.

### Monocolour hybrid `{N/C}` — ✅ DONE (`01fe254`)
`ManaCost.mono_hybrid: Vec<(u32,Color)>` (serde-default) — each `{2/R}` pip payable by ONE mana of the
colour OR `n` generic; `select_payment` prefers the colour side (uses fewer units, never starves a later
pip), else falls back to `n` generic (after fixed + two-colour hybrid, before generic). `mana_value` adds
each pip's `n` (CR 202.3g); `Display` now renders both `{c1/c2}` and `{n/C}` pips; `mana_cost_mono_hybrid()`
builder. **Also fixed a latent bug:** the cast-payment cost at `priority.rs` was dropping `hybrid`
(and would have dropped `mono_hybrid`) — an all-mono-hybrid card would have cast **free** with zero
Converge colours. Now the payment carries `hybrid`+`mono_hybrid` through, so they're actually paid and
their spent colours feed Converge (this also fixes two-colour hybrid under-costing, e.g. Stirring
Honormancer). New `ValueExpr::ColorsSpentOnTrigger` (colours spent on the *triggering* spell — the
colours-of-trigger analogue of `ManaSpentOnTrigger`) for Magmablood's cast-trigger.
→ **Magmablood Archaic** (fully implemented: Converge enters-with `ColorsSpent` + Opus mass-pump by
`ColorsSpentOnTrigger`), **Wildgrowth Archaic** (`.incomplete()`: mono-hybrid + Converge body work; the
creature-cast "enters with X additional counters" trigger is deferred — needs a delayed enters-with
replacement keyed to another spell on the stack, an unbuilt mechanism).
_Latent gap (not blocking, no consumer):_ `mana_spent` (Dyadrine's `ValueExpr::ManaSpent`) is still
computed as `generic + colored` at cast, so it under-counts hybrid/mono-hybrid pips. No hybrid card reads
`ManaSpent` today; fix needs `auto_pay` to also report the unit count spent.

Next hybrid follow-up: rebuild the creature-died flag *with* Essenceknit Scholar (now unblocked); then
Moseo, Abstract Paintmage.

## Discard-cost activated — ✅ DONE (`CostComponent::Discard` wired)
`CostComponent::Discard(SelectSpec)` already existed but was **defined-but-unpaid** (`_ => {}` in
`pay_cost`, `_ => true` in `can_pay_cost`). Now wired: `can_pay_cost` gates on having ≥`min` matching
cards in `spec.zone` (the hand); `pay_cost` calls `pay_discard` (mirrors `pay_sacrifice` — asks which to
discard when there's a choice, moves to graveyard). `can_pay_cost` made `pub(crate)` for card-level cost
tests. → **Charging Strifeknight** (`{T}, Discard a card: Draw`). Unblocks the discard-cost half of
Hardened Academic (still needs S9-trigger — has one) / Rubble Rouser (reflexive-mana, defer).

## S18 graveyard-activated — ✅ DONE (`6190bb2`)
_(scoped plan below, now implemented: `CostComponent::ExileSelfFromGraveyard` + graveyard enumeration in `legal_priority_actions` + exile-on-pay. → Eternal Student, Stone Docent. Postmortem Professor / Rubble Rouser still deferred.)_

### original plan
Cards: **Eternal Student** (`{1}{B}, Exile this from your graveyard: create two Inklings`), **Stone
Docent** (`{W}, Exile this from graveyard: gain 2, surveil 1; sorcery-speed`). (Postmortem Professor /
Rubble Rouser need reanimate-self / reflexive-mana — defer.)
1. `effects/ability.rs`: `CostComponent::ExileSelfFromGraveyard` — both the "exile this card" cost AND
   the marker that this `Activated` ability is usable from the graveyard (no new zone field on
   `Activated`; the cost component signals the zone, keeping the literals unbroken).
2. `priority.rs` `legal_priority_actions`: after the battlefield activated-ability scan, scan
   `player.graveyard`; for each card whose def has an `Activated` ability whose cost contains
   `ExileSelfFromGraveyard`, offer it if the mana is affordable and timing ok (respect
   `Restriction`/sorcery-speed).
3. Paying: exile the card (move to Exile) as part of the cost, then the ability's effect resolves.
4. Test: card in graveyard + mana → offered; activate → card exiled + effect ran (two Inklings).

## S15 impulse-play — ◑ BASE DONE (`d079eb0`) — adopted from orphaned predecessor WIP

**Provenance:** the engine base (steps 1–2 below) was found as ~90%-complete **uncommitted** work in the
shared tree — a predecessor was mid-build when its process was terminated to free resources. Reviewed
hunk-by-hunk against this plan, confirmed compiling + consistent with the warp/flashback idioms, then
hardened with tests I wrote (interpreter arm, ETB exile+grant, offer window/expiry) and landed with the
first consumer card.

**Shipped:** `Effect::ExileForPlay { what, window: PlayWindow }` + `Action::ExileForPlay { obj, until }`
+ `Object.play_until_turn: Option<u32>` (reset on any zone change, CR 400.7) + the **unified** exile-cast
offer loop in `legal_priority_actions` (warp-recast = sorcery-speed/no-limit; impulse = card's own timing
within `play_until_turn`). Whiteboard interpreter arm handles the **`Target`** source with 2-player
"your next turn" arithmetic (+2 if it's already your turn, else +1). → **Practiced Scrollsmith** (ETB
exile a target noncreature/nonland card from your gy, castable until end of your next turn).

**Top-of-library source — ✅ DONE (`0e17d3e`):** `EffectTarget::TopOfLibrary(PlayerRef)` + a `resolve_target`
arm (returns the top card = `library.last()`, no-op on empty); the existing `ExileForPlay` arm handles it
unchanged → Elemental Mascot, Suspend Aggression.

**Land-play-from-exile — ✅ DONE (`0e17d3e`):** the land-drop block in `legal_priority_actions` now also
offers `PlayLand` for an impulse-exiled land (`castable_from_exile` + `play_until_turn` within window),
respecting the land-per-turn limit; `play_land`→`MoveZone`→`move_object` already handles the exile source
zone. (Distinct from the pre-existing `PlayLandsFrom`-permission branch at priority.rs ~977.)

**Still ⏳ — Graveyard-play** (`PlayWindow::ThisTurn` from the graveyard) — Ark of Hunger / Tablet of
Discovery play a **milled** card (graveyard, not exile); `castable_from_exile`/the offer loop scan only
exile. Needs a graveyard analog (a `play_from_graveyard_until` flag + a graveyard scan in the offer loop,
OR generalise the flag zone-agnostically). Defer to a fresh increment WITH Ark of Hunger (Tablet also
needs S13). Revert-unused-cap precedent.

### original scoped plan (foundation already existed)
"Exile [a card] — you may **play** it until [end of turn / end of your next turn]." **Good news:** the
warp-recast mechanism already gives us most of it — `Object.castable_from_exile: bool`
(`state/mod.rs:157`, reset on any zone change per CR 400.7) + an offer loop (`priority.rs:1029-1041`)
that already offers *casting* an exiled card with that flag for its normal mana cost. S15 = **extend**
that, don't rebuild:
1. **Effect to exile-and-permit.** Add `Effect::ImpulseExile { source, count, until }` (or extend an
   exile effect) that moves the card(s) to exile AND sets `castable_from_exile = true` + a new
   `Object.play_until_turn: Option<u32>` marker (absolute turn number). `source` covers: top-of-library
   (Elemental Mascot, Suspend Aggression's top card), a chosen target permanent (Suspend Aggression's
   "exile target nonland permanent"), a target graveyard card (Practiced Scrollsmith).
2. **Offer loop (`priority.rs:1029`) — three gaps to close vs warp-recast:**
   - **Timing:** warp-recast is sorcery-speed only; impulse follows the *card's own* timing (instant/
     Flash → instant speed) — mirror the flashback timing check at `priority.rs:1049-1051`.
   - **Lands:** the flag currently only drives `Cast`; a *land* in exile with the flag needs a
     `play_land`-from-exile offer (impulse "play", not just "cast").
   - **Expiry:** skip the offer when `play_until_turn` has passed. Set it: "until end of turn" =
     current turn number; "until end of your next turn" = your next turn's number (spans an opponent
     turn — compute from turn order). Clear expired markers in `begin_turn` (`priority.rs:687`, next to
     the `life_gained_this_turn = 0` resets) or leave them (expiry is checked at offer time anyway).
3. **Zone note:** Tablet of Discovery plays a **milled** card (from the *graveyard*, not exile). Either
   generalise the flag to "playable-from-current-zone" or scope Tablet separately; the exile cases
   (Elemental Mascot, Suspend Aggression, Practiced Scrollsmith, Archaic's Agony, Ark of Hunger,
   Suspend Aggression, Practiced Offense) are the clean first batch.
4. **Cards:** Elemental Mascot (S5 Opus + impulse), Suspend Aggression, Practiced Scrollsmith
   (mono-hybrid `{R/W}` — done), Archaic's Agony (S7 + impulse), Ark of Hunger (S9 + impulse), Tablet of
   Discovery (S13 + impulse, graveyard-play). Test: exile top card → it's offered as a play → play it →
   resolves; after expiry it's no longer offered.

## S13 restricted-mana — ✅ DONE (`ffcc0df`)

Implemented per the scoped plan below, with one scope note. `ManaSpec.restriction: Option<SpendRestriction>`
(`InstantSorceryOnly`) + a separate `ManaPool.restricted` bucket (empties with the pool). `allow_restricted`
is threaded `payment_units → can_pay_excluding/auto_pay_ex` (thin `can_pay`/`can_pay_ex`/`auto_pay` wrappers
keep the ~26 existing `can_pay` call sites untouched); restricted pool mana + restricted mana sources
(`restricted_mana_sources`, split out of `producible_colors`) fold in only when the cost is an instant/sorcery
cast. Cast/offer sites pass `card is I/S`; ability-cost sites pass `false`. `spend_from_pool` spends restricted
mana first (no waste); `add_mana` routes restricted production to the bucket. → **Hydro-Channeler** (`{T}: Add
{U}` restricted). Tests prove restricted mana pays an I/S cost but not a creature spell / ability cost, both
from a source tap and from floating mana.

**Scope notes:**
- **Hydro-Channeler's 2nd ability** (`{1},{T}: Add any color`, restricted) is **deferred** — it's a mana ability
  with a *mana activation cost*, which the auto-pay source model treats as free-to-tap (would offer free rainbow
  mana). Omitted rather than shipped broken; needs a mana-ability-with-activation-cost cap (also blocks filter lands).
- **Manual `produce_mana`/`usable_mana_sources`** (UI-only path) still don't expose restricted sources — a documented
  UI follow-up (like the hybrid-pip one); the engine/gym auto-pay path is fully correct.
- **Remaining S13 consumers:** Abstract Paintmage (mono-hybrid done + a first-main-phase trigger that floats
  restricted `{U}{R}` — the bucket already handles floating restricted mana, so this is just the trigger + `add_mana`,
  already wired), Great Hall of the Biblioplex (also needs land-animate — defer that clause), Tablet of Discovery
  (also needs S15 graveyard-play).

### original scoped plan (kept for reference)
"Add {U}{R}. **Spend this mana only to cast instant and sorcery spells.**" All 4 cards use the SAME
restriction (I/S-only), so a bool suffices. The cost: threading "am I casting an I/S spell" through the
payment path (the reason the lead flagged it for a fresh, non-tired start).
1. `ManaSpec`: add `restriction: Option<SpendRestriction>` (enum, one variant `InstantSorceryOnly` for
   now). `add_mana` (`whiteboard.rs:644`) routes restricted mana to a new bucket.
2. `ManaPool` (`basics.rs:200`): add `restricted: BTreeMap<Color,u32>` (I/S-only mana). Empty it wherever
   `amounts` empties (CR 500.5).
3. **Thread `allow_restricted: bool`** through `payment_units` → `select_payment` → `auto_pay` /
   `can_pay_excluding`. When true, fold the restricted bucket into the available units; when false, ignore
   it. Keep `can_pay(state,p,cost)` as a thin wrapper defaulting `allow_restricted=false` so the ~8 test
   call sites and non-spell payments are unaffected.
4. **Call sites** (from the survey): spell-cast payment `priority.rs:1753` → pass `card` is instant|sorcery;
   ability-cost `pay_cost`/`can_pay_cost` (`1434`,`1218`) → `false` (restricted mana can't pay ability
   costs); offer gates (`1012`,`1019`,`1034`,`1055`) → per-card `is instant|sorcery`.
5. **Cards:** Hydro-Channeler (`{T}:Add {U}` restricted — cleanest lander), Abstract Paintmage (mono-hybrid
   `{U/R}` done + first-main-phase trigger adds restricted `{U}{R}`), Great Hall of the Biblioplex (also
   needs land-animate — defer that clause), Tablet of Discovery (also needs S15). Ship the cap with
   Hydro-Channeler. Test: restricted mana pays an I/S spell but NOT a creature spell / an ability cost.

## Session note (git hygiene)
Shared **index** in this working tree: plain `git commit` (even after `git add <my paths>`) commits the
WHOLE index and sweeps up teammates' pre-staged files. ALWAYS `git commit --only <explicit paths> -m`.
(Matches the [[shared-tree-git-hygiene]] memory's `git commit -- <paths>` rule — follow it.)
