# Card-implementation push — Secrets of Strixhaven (`sos`, 271 distinct cards)

Standing workstream: implement the Secrets of Strixhaven set for **limited (40-card) play** in
`mtg-core`, easiest-first, correctness over count. This ledger is the capability index + full
per-card triage, modeled on `SELESNYA_LANDFALL_CARDS.md`.

**Card data lives in the SQLite index, never memory** (CLAUDE.md "Card data"):
```
sqlite3 data/scryfall/cards.sqlite \
  "SELECT mana_cost,type_line,power,toughness,oracle_text,rarity
     FROM cards WHERE set_code='sos' AND name='<card>' ORDER BY released_at DESC LIMIT 1;"
```
Always re-read the oracle text from the db before authoring a card.

## Folder placement (first-printing rule)

Per repo convention a card lives in its **first-printing real-expansion** folder. For SoS that is
`sos/` for **255** of the 271 (the promo/prerelease codes `psos`/`pvow` collapse to `sos`/`vow`).
The genuine older reprints go elsewhere and **may already exist / should be reused, not duplicated**:

| Card | folder | note |
|---|---|---|
| Essence Scatter | `m10` | reprint |
| Last Gasp | `rav` | reprint |
| Quick Study | `woe` | reprint |
| Seize the Spoils | `khm` | reprint |
| Terramorphic Expanse | `tsp` | reprint (verify first-print at author time) |
| Ancestral Anger, Deathcap Glade, Dreamroot Cascade, Shattered Sanctum, Stormcarved Coast, Sundown Pass | `vow` | Crimson Vow reprints (6) |

`Erode` (`sos`) and the five basics (`misc`) are **already implemented** — reuse.

## Triage summary (2026-07-03)

271 distinct cards triaged against the **current** engine (Selesnya-push IR + Crew + Warp):

| Tier | Meaning | Count |
|---|---|---|
| **T1** | vanilla / french-vanilla (implemented keywords only) | **6** (5 basics done + Rearing Embermare) |
| **T2** | expressible in existing IR, **no new cap** | **68** |
| **T3** | needs one small card-agnostic cap (an S-cap below) | **142** |
| **T4** | needs a major subsystem — **deferred** | **55** (36 modal-DFC + 19 subsystem cards) |

The DFC bucket is deferred by CLAUDE.md first-pass scope ("double-faced / split … leave unbuilt").
So the reachable near-term pool is **T1 + T2 (74) then the T3 long tail (142)** as caps land.

## Capability ledger — small caps SoS needs (S-caps)

Card-agnostic caps to build in the Selesnya style (new `EventPattern` / `ValueExpr` / `Condition` /
`Effect` leaf / `Qualification` / `Rewrite` / `TokenSpec` field). Build **highest-leverage first**;
each cap unlocks the bracketed count. `⏳` = not yet built.

| Cap | What it adds | Cards | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S1** Surveil N | look at top N, put any number in graveyard, rest back (CR 701.42) — `Effect::Surveil` | 15 | ✅ **DONE** `cc58a7b` |
| **S5** Opus | `SpellCast(I/S you control)` trigger + `ValueExpr::ManaSpentOnTrigger` + `≥5` condition | 13 | ✅ **DONE** `e85771e` |
| **S8** Repartee | `SpellCast(I/S you control **that targets a creature**)` trigger (inspect cast targets) | 12 | ✅ **DONE** |
| **S4** Infusion | per-turn per-player "gained life this turn" state + a `Condition` reading it | 12 | ✅ **DONE** `89b3581` |
| **S10** Flashback | alt-cast from graveyard for a flashback cost, then exile (Warp-analogue) | 11 | ⏳ |
| **S6** Increment | `SpellCast(you)` trigger + condition "mana spent > this creature's power OR toughness" | 9 | ✅ **DONE** |
| **S7** Converge | `ValueExpr::ColorsOfManaSpent` (ETB counters / X in Converge spells) | 9 | ⏳ |
| **S9** Graveyard-leave | "cards leave your graveyard" trigger + "a card left your graveyard this turn" cond | 8 | ✅ **DONE** (flag `f9b5584` + trigger: LeftGraveyard event snapshot in resolve_effect → Spirit Mascot, Owlin Historian, Garrison Excavator) |
| **S2** Look-and-pick | look at top N, put one/some in hand, rest on bottom (impulse selection) | 8 | ⏳ |
| **S12** Cost-reduction cond. | "costs {N} less if it targets X / you control Y / a card left your gy" (cast-time) | 7 | ⏳ |
| **S14** Copy spell/perm | "copy target spell", "create a token that's a copy of" (heavier small-cap) | 7 | ⏳ **token-copy DONE** (`Effect::CreateTokenCopy`+`TokenCopyMods`, `a8c8a2d` → Applied Geometry); **spell-copy** portion still ⏳ |
| **S17** Ward {cost} | Ward N / Ward—Pay life / Ward—Discard (counter-unless-pay on becoming targeted) | 7 | ⏳ |
| **S15** Impulse play | exile/mill → "you may play it until end of turn / your next turn" | 6 | ⏳ |
| **S3** Stun counters | `CounterKind::Stun` + "would untap → remove a stun counter instead" replacement | 6 | ⏳ |
| **S18** Graveyard-activated | an ability that functions while its card is in the graveyard (recursion) | 6 | ⏳ |
| **S11** Token-with-ability | `TokenSpec` carries an ability (Treasure `{T},Sac`; Pest attack→gain life) | 5 | ⏳ |
| **S13** Restricted mana | mana usable "only to cast instant and sorcery spells" (spend-restriction tag) | 4 | ⏳ |
| **S16** Gain-life trigger | `EventPattern::GainLife` ("whenever you gain life, …") | 3 | ✅ **DONE** |
| **S21** cast-with-{X} trigger | `SpellCast` filtered to "has {X} in its cost" | 2 | ⏳ |
| **S19/S20/S22** | cards-drawn-this-turn value / counters-on-target value / cast-I/S-this-turn cond | 1 ea | ⏳ |
| **misc one-offs** | GreatestMV, DistinctNames, SoftCounter (counter-unless-pay), DirectedDiscard, AltCost, PayXLife, NoMaxHand, GrantAbility | 1–3 ea | ⏳ |
| **Native** | genuine one-offs via the `Native` escape hatch: Mathemagics (2^X), Pox Plague (halving), Steal the Show (wheel) | 4 | ⏳ |

Building **S1, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S10** (the seven big-count caps) converts ~**79** T3 cards to authorable.

## Engine reality-check — unimplemented effect leaves (E-caps) — **found during Phase 2**

The Phase-1 rubric assumed several `Effect` variants were interpreted; grepping the whiteboard
interpreter (`whiteboard.rs`) shows **six IR leaves are defined but interpreted nowhere** — a card
using one silently no-ops. So the true near-term T2 pool is **smaller than the 68 tallied above**:
some of those cards actually need one of these leaves wired first. These are the highest-leverage
caps (each is a small, card-agnostic interpreter arm lowering to an already-existing `Action`).

| E-cap | Effect leaf | Blocks (examples) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **E1** | `Effect::MoveZone` (bounce / return-to-hand / reanimate) | Zealous Lorecaster, Banishing Betrayal, Proctor's Gaze, Prismari Charm, Matterbending Mage, Pull from the Grave, Moment of Reckoning, Lorehold Charm | ✅ **DONE** `0e85b76` (single-target; multi-target "up to two" still TODO) |
| **E2** | `Effect::Counter` (counter target spell), respecting `CantBeCountered` | Essence Scatter, Brush Off, Mana Sculpt, Quandrix Charm | ✅ **DONE** `eb2b364` (+ stack-zone static gathering; closed Surrak's deferral) |
| **E3** | `Effect::Discard` (loot "then discard a card"; "target player discards") | Traumatic Critique, Stadium Tidalmage, Charging Strifeknight, Rubble Rouser, Colossus, Rapturous Moment, Borrowed Knowledge, Send in the Pest | ✅ **DONE** `506baf9` |
| **E4** | `Effect::Sacrifice` (as an effect — "each player sacrifices", "sacrifice two lands") | Planar Engineering, Witherbloom Charm, Social Snub (needs S14 copy too), Pox Plague | ✅ **DONE** `b5ea234` (per-player: Controller / EachPlayer / EachOpponent) |
| **E5** | `Effect::Repeat` | (few) | ⏳ |
| **E6** | `Effect::Distribute` | (few) | ⏳ |

**Loud guard (`8604b34`):** `materialize()` is now an **exhaustive** match — a defined-but-unwired
`Effect` leaf `debug_assert!`s loudly in debug/tests instead of silently no-oping (the bug class that
hid Traumatic Critique's discard), and a NEW IR variant with no arm is a *compile* error. The only
remaining loud-assert leaves are E5 `Repeat`, E6 `Distribute`, and `Native` (no runtime yet).

**Wired today (safe for T2 authoring):** DealDamage, Draw, Destroy, Exile, GainLife, LoseLife, PumpPT,
GrantKeyword, GrantQualification, BecomeCreature, AddMana, PutCounters, CreateToken, Fight, Search,
Tap, Modal, Optional, IfYouDo, ForEach, Conditional, Earthbend, **MoveZone, Discard, Counter (new)**.

Next-highest leverage: **E4 Sacrifice** (each-player-sacrifices / sac-as-effect), then the S-caps
(S1 Surveil, S4 Infusion, S5 Opus, …).

## Deferred subsystems (T4 — do NOT build now)

| Subsystem | Cards | Count |
|---|---|---|
| Modal double-faced (DFC) | the `… // …` cards (Emeritus cycle, all creature/spell MDFCs) | 36 |
| Lesson / **Paradigm** (recast-copy-from-exile each main phase) | Decorum Dissertation, Echocasting Symposium, Germination Practicum, Improvisation Capstone, Restoration Seminar | 5 |
| **Planeswalker** loyalty | Professor Dellian Fel, Ral Zarek Guest Lecturer | 2 |
| **Prepare / prepared** marker | Biblioplex Tomekeeper, Skycoach Waypoint | 2 |
| **Storm** | Prismari, the Inspiration | 1 |
| **Cascade** | Quandrix, the Proof | 1 |
| **Miracle** | Lorehold, the Historian | 1 |
| **Casualty** | Silverquill, the Disputant | 1 |
| **Affinity** (dynamic cost) | Witherbloom, the Balancer | 1 |
| **Grandeur** | Page, Loose Leaf | 1 |

## 10 easiest (author these first — all T1/T2, no new cap)

1. **Quick Study** — `{2}{U}` draw two cards. Pure `Draw`.
2. **Rearing Embermare** — `{4}{R}` 4/5, "Reach, haste" — french-vanilla (T1).
3. **Last Gasp** — `{1}{B}` target creature gets −3/−3 EOT. `PumpPT`.
4. **Essence Scatter** — `{1}{U}` counter target creature spell. `Counter`.
5. **Wander Off** — `{3}{B}` exile target creature. `Exile`.
6. **Grapple with Death** — `{1}{B}{G}` destroy target artifact/creature, gain 1. `Destroy`+`GainLife`.
7. **Interjection** — `{W}` +2/+2 and first strike EOT. `PumpPT`+`GrantKeyword`.
8. **Chase Inspiration** — `{U}` +0/+3 and hexproof EOT. `PumpPT`+`GrantKeyword`.
9. **Oracle's Restoration** — `{G}` +1/+1 EOT, draw a card, gain 1. `PumpPT`+`Draw`+`GainLife`.
10. **Cost of Brilliance** — `{2}{B}` target player draws 2 & loses 2; +1/+1 on up-to-one creature.

(Deep T2 bench also ready: Dissection Practice, Traumatic Critique, Sneering Shadewriter,
Environmental Scientist, Harsh Annotation, Vibrant Outburst, Masterful Flourish, Shopkeeper's Bane.)

## 10 hardest (all T4 — deferred; here for the record)

1. **Prismari, the Inspiration** — Elder Dragon; grants **Storm** to all your I/S spells.
2. **Quandrix, the Proof** — Elder Dragon; has **Cascade** and grants it to your I/S.
3. **Lorehold, the Historian** — Elder Dragon; grants **Miracle {2}** to I/S in hand.
4. **Silverquill, the Disputant** — Elder Dragon; your I/S have **Casualty 1**.
5. **Witherbloom, the Balancer** — Elder Dragon; **Affinity for creatures** + grants it (dynamic cost).
6. **Professor Dellian Fel** — planeswalker; 4 loyalty abilities + emblem (whole PW subsystem).
7. **Ral Zarek, Guest Lecturer** — planeswalker; −7 "flip five coins, skip X turns".
8. **Restoration Seminar** (+ the 4 other Lessons) — **Paradigm**: exile & recast a free copy each main phase.
9. **Nita, Forum Conciliator** — cast spells you don't own + exile-and-cast opponents' graveyard spells.
10. **Petrified Hamlet** — ETB choose a card name, then name-scoped static grants/restrictions.

## Authoring plan

1. **T1/T2 sweep** — the 68 T2 + Rearing Embermare need no engine work; author them first (each: data
   IR + expect-test snapshot + a behaviour test for any effect; honest `fully_implemented`). This is
   the bulk of the immediately-shippable pool.
2. **Cap-then-cards** — build S-caps highest-leverage first (S1 Surveil, then S4/S5/S6/S7/S8/S10), each
   its own commit in the card-agnostic style (new IR node + tests), then author the T3 cards that cap
   unlocks. Keep `cargo test -p mtg-core` green at every commit.
3. **Defer T4** — mark deferred here, do not build. If a T3 card has one deferrable clause beyond its
   cap, ship the core with a documented `// deferred:` note (the established Humility/Rancor pattern).
4. A `sos_limited` preset deck once enough of the pool is playable.

## S10 Flashback — scoped implementation plan (warp-mirror)

Flashback is structurally the **warp** mechanic (alt-cost cast from a non-hand zone + a zone change
when it resolves). Mirror warp site-for-site:

1. `effects/ability.rs`: add `Ability::Flashback { cost: ManaCost }` (like `Ability::Warp`) and
   `CastVariant::Flashback`.
2. `state/mod.rs`: add `Object.flashback_cast: bool` (mirror `warp_cast`); reset it in `move_object`
   (CR 400.7) alongside `warp_cast`.
3. `priority.rs`:
   - `flashback_cost(card)` helper (mirror `warp_cost`, reads `Ability::Flashback`).
   - `legal_priority_actions` (~958): offer `CastVariant::Flashback` for cards **in the graveyard**
     whose def has `Ability::Flashback`, at the card's normal timing (sorcery→sorcery-speed,
     instant→instant-speed). Mirror the warp-from-hand block (~1009) but source = `Zone::Graveyard`.
   - `cost_for_variant` (~1489): `CastVariant::Flashback => self.flashback_cost(card)`.
   - source-zone removal (~1655): allow `Zone::Graveyard` for a flashback cast.
   - set `o.flashback_cast = true` at cast (mirror warp_cast flag ~1508).
   - `resolve_top` (~1928/1992): if `flashback_cast`, move the card to **Exile** instead of graveyard
     (CR 702.34 — "instead of putting it anywhere else, exile it"). This is the one place flashback
     *differs* from warp (warp arms an end-step exile; flashback exiles immediately on resolution).
4. Cards: Daydream, Antiquities on the Loose, Dig Site Inventory, Duel Tactics, Practiced Offense,
   Flashback (the card), etc. — each declares `Ability::Flashback { cost }` + its normal spell effect.

Test: cast a sorcery from graveyard via Flashback → effect resolves → card is in Exile (not graveyard);
and it's no longer offered for a second flashback.

## S11 token-with-ability — ✅ DONE (`bf22f6b`, synthetic token defs)

**Decision (lead-approved):** `TokenSpec.grp_id` (0 = vanilla) + pre-registered token defs in the reserved
**9000+** block (`grp::PEST_TOKEN = 9001`). Rationale: keeps token abilities in *defs* (card-agnostic
law — no name-match), mirrors how MTGA ids tokens, and the reserved block sits far above organically
growing real-card ids (~290) so no collision. **Confirmed** the `/api/cards` catalog filters
`!supertypes.contains(Token)` (server.rs:500), so the Pest def does **not** leak into the deck-builder;
token defs still flow into the art manifest (intended — tokens get art). `SelfAttacks` already fires,
so the Pest's attack-trigger works via `def_of`. Shipped: Send in the Pest, Pestbrood Sloth (Essenceknit
Scholar / Moseo defer — creature-died-this-turn / Infusion-X-reanimate clauses).

### original plan (kept for reference)

Problem: a token's ability lookup is `def_of(id)` → `CardDb.get(chars.grp_id)`; there is no
object-level ability storage, and the db is `Arc<CardDb>`. Keywords already ride on
`TokenSpec.keywords`; only *triggered/activated* token abilities (the Pest dies-trigger) need this.

Approach — give ability-bearing tokens a real `grp_id` pointing at a pre-registered def:
1. `effects/target.rs`: add `grp_id: u32` to `TokenSpec` (no `Default` derive, so **update all 8
   existing `TokenSpec {…}` literals** in `cards/helpers.rs` with `grp_id: 0` — vanilla/keyword-only
   tokens). Bump the `TokenSpec` serde/expect snapshots.
2. `whiteboard.rs` `create_token`: set `chars.grp_id = spec.grp_id;` (0 → no def, as today).
3. `cards/`: pre-register the **Pest token def** (`{}` 1/1 B/G Pest, `Triggered{SelfEnters? no —
   SelfDies, GainLife 1}`) in `starter_db` under a reserved id (e.g. `grp::PEST_TOKEN = 90001`), and
   set `helpers::pest_token().grp_id = PEST_TOKEN`. `SelfDies` is already wired (priority.rs 2539), so
   the trigger fires once the token carries the ability via `def_of`.
4. Cards (4): Send in the Pest, Essenceknit Scholar, Moseo (Vein's New Dean), Pestbrood Sloth.

Test: create a Pest token, kill it (SBA), assert its controller gained 1 life (the dies-trigger fired
through the synthetic def).

## S14 token-copy — ✅ DONE (`a8c8a2d`)
`Effect::CreateTokenCopy { source: EffectTarget, controller, mods: TokenCopyMods }` — the materialize
arm snapshots the source's **copiable** characteristics (its base `chars`: name/types/subtypes/colors/
P·T + abilities via the copied `grp_id`; **not** counters/damage/auras/other continuous effects, CR
707.2) into a `TokenSpec`, applies the `mods` CR 707.9e "except" overrides (`add_card_types` /
`add_subtypes` / `set_power_toughness` / `counters`), then reuses the existing `create_token` path.
`collect_specs_into` gained a `CreateTokenCopy{ source: Target }` arm so the copy target is enumerated
at cast. → **Applied Geometry** (copy a permanent as a 0/0 Fractal + six +1/+1 → a 6/6).
**Deferred token-copy consumers:** Colorstorm Stallion (also needs S17 Ward — build with Ward, uses the
SourceSelf/empty-`mods` copy-self path), Echocasting Symposium (Paradigm, T4). The **spell-copy** half
of S14 ("copy target/that spell" → a copy on the stack — Aziza, Choreographed Sparks, Mica, Social Snub,
Lumaret's Favor) is a **different mechanic** (stack object, not a battlefield token) and is still ⏳.

## Hybrid mana — the next high-value blocker (7 non-DFC cards)

`ManaCost` has no hybrid `{X/Y}` pip. This blocks 7 non-DFC SoS cards (Essenceknit Scholar,
Stirring Honormancer, Moseo, Abstract Paintmage, …) AND their riders. Scope:
- `basics::ManaCost`: add a hybrid-pip representation (e.g. `hybrid: Vec<(Color, Color)>`, each payable
  by either colour; keep `colored`/`generic` as-is).
- `mana::select_payment`: when planning, satisfy each hybrid pip with whichever of its two colours the
  player can produce (try both). `mana_value` counts each hybrid pip as 1.
- Card builders: extend `mana_cost` (or add `mana_cost_hybrid`) to author `{B/G}` etc.
Note: the **"creature died under your control this turn" flag** was scoped + reverted (only consumer,
Essenceknit Scholar, is hybrid-blocked) — rebuild it *with* Essenceknit once hybrid mana lands. Pattern
mirrors `cards_left_graveyard_this_turn`: Player counter, increment in the CreatureDies SBA (by the
creature's controller at death), reset in begin_turn, `Condition::CreatureDiedThisTurn`.

## Remaining cap queue (all engine files released; pick by fresh-context fit)
- **Hybrid mana** (above) — 7 cards, payment-planner change.
- **S7 Converge** — track *colors* of mana spent at cast (extend `auto_pay` to report spent colours →
  record `Object.colors_spent` → `ValueExpr::ColorsOfManaSpent`). ~8 Archaic-cycle cards.
- **S18 graveyard-activated** — activate an ability from the graveyard (discard/exile cost); extend the
  activated-ability enumeration to scan the graveyard for a graveyard-source ability.
- **S9-trigger** (graveyard-leave event), **CreatureDies trigger** (needs LKI), **S14 token-copy**
  (extends S11 — copy the target's `grp_id`+chars onto the token).

## Precedent: revert-rather-than-ship-unused-cap
When a scoped cap's *only* consumer turns out to be blocked by a different missing feature, **revert the
cap** rather than ship engine infra (a field / Condition / ValueExpr) with no card exercising it. Ship
caps only with a card that lands them. (Established when the "creature-died-this-turn" flag's only user,
Essenceknit Scholar, was found hybrid-mana-blocked — flag reverted, rebuild it *with* Essenceknit once
hybrid lands.)

## Hybrid mana — ✅ DONE (`8daf069`, `{X/Y}` two-colour pips)
`ManaCost.hybrid: Vec<(Color,Color)>` (serde-default) + `select_payment` satisfies each hybrid pip with
a unit of either colour (after fixed pips, before generic; shared by `can_pay`+`auto_pay`) + `mana_value`
counts each hybrid pip as 1 + `mana_cost_hybrid()` builder. **Wire:** gym `obs.rs` doesn't encode raw
ManaCost fields (transparent); the web client (`main.ts`) renders from `generic`/`colored` and ignores
`hybrid` → a hybrid card shows its pip incomplete but **does not crash** (graceful, per lead). Follow-up
(UI team): render `{X/Y}` pips in `main.ts`. → Stirring Honormancer.

### Monocolour hybrid `{N/C}` — ✅ DONE (`01fe254`)
`ManaCost.mono_hybrid: Vec<(u32,Color)>` (serde-default) — each `{2/R}` pip payable by ONE mana of the
colour OR `n` generic; `select_payment` prefers the colour side (uses fewer units, never starves a later
pip), else falls back to `n` generic (after fixed + two-colour hybrid, before generic). `mana_value` adds
each pip's `n` (CR 202.3g); `Display` now renders both `{c1/c2}` and `{n/C}` pips; `mana_cost_mono_hybrid()`
builder. **Also fixed a latent bug:** the cast-payment cost at `priority.rs` was dropping `hybrid`
(and would have dropped `mono_hybrid`) — an all-mono-hybrid card would have cast **free** with zero
Converge colours. Now the payment carries `hybrid`+`mono_hybrid` through, so they're actually paid and
their spent colours feed Converge (this also fixes two-colour hybrid under-costing, e.g. Stirring
Honormancer). New `ValueExpr::ColorsSpentOnTrigger` (colours spent on the *triggering* spell — the
colours-of-trigger analogue of `ManaSpentOnTrigger`) for Magmablood's cast-trigger.
→ **Magmablood Archaic** (fully implemented: Converge enters-with `ColorsSpent` + Opus mass-pump by
`ColorsSpentOnTrigger`), **Wildgrowth Archaic** (`.incomplete()`: mono-hybrid + Converge body work; the
creature-cast "enters with X additional counters" trigger is deferred — needs a delayed enters-with
replacement keyed to another spell on the stack, an unbuilt mechanism).
_Latent gap (not blocking, no consumer):_ `mana_spent` (Dyadrine's `ValueExpr::ManaSpent`) is still
computed as `generic + colored` at cast, so it under-counts hybrid/mono-hybrid pips. No hybrid card reads
`ManaSpent` today; fix needs `auto_pay` to also report the unit count spent.

Next hybrid follow-up: rebuild the creature-died flag *with* Essenceknit Scholar (now unblocked); then
Moseo, Abstract Paintmage.

## Discard-cost activated — ✅ DONE (`CostComponent::Discard` wired)
`CostComponent::Discard(SelectSpec)` already existed but was **defined-but-unpaid** (`_ => {}` in
`pay_cost`, `_ => true` in `can_pay_cost`). Now wired: `can_pay_cost` gates on having ≥`min` matching
cards in `spec.zone` (the hand); `pay_cost` calls `pay_discard` (mirrors `pay_sacrifice` — asks which to
discard when there's a choice, moves to graveyard). `can_pay_cost` made `pub(crate)` for card-level cost
tests. → **Charging Strifeknight** (`{T}, Discard a card: Draw`). Unblocks the discard-cost half of
Hardened Academic (still needs S9-trigger — has one) / Rubble Rouser (reflexive-mana, defer).

## S18 graveyard-activated — ✅ DONE (`6190bb2`)
_(scoped plan below, now implemented: `CostComponent::ExileSelfFromGraveyard` + graveyard enumeration in `legal_priority_actions` + exile-on-pay. → Eternal Student, Stone Docent. Postmortem Professor / Rubble Rouser still deferred.)_

### original plan
Cards: **Eternal Student** (`{1}{B}, Exile this from your graveyard: create two Inklings`), **Stone
Docent** (`{W}, Exile this from graveyard: gain 2, surveil 1; sorcery-speed`). (Postmortem Professor /
Rubble Rouser need reanimate-self / reflexive-mana — defer.)
1. `effects/ability.rs`: `CostComponent::ExileSelfFromGraveyard` — both the "exile this card" cost AND
   the marker that this `Activated` ability is usable from the graveyard (no new zone field on
   `Activated`; the cost component signals the zone, keeping the literals unbroken).
2. `priority.rs` `legal_priority_actions`: after the battlefield activated-ability scan, scan
   `player.graveyard`; for each card whose def has an `Activated` ability whose cost contains
   `ExileSelfFromGraveyard`, offer it if the mana is affordable and timing ok (respect
   `Restriction`/sorcery-speed).
3. Paying: exile the card (move to Exile) as part of the cost, then the ability's effect resolves.
4. Test: card in graveyard + mana → offered; activate → card exiled + effect ran (two Inklings).

## Session note (git hygiene)
Shared **index** in this working tree: plain `git commit` (even after `git add <my paths>`) commits the
WHOLE index and sweeps up teammates' pre-staged files. ALWAYS `git commit --only <explicit paths> -m`.
(Matches the [[shared-tree-git-hygiene]] memory's `git commit -- <paths>` rule — follow it.)
