# Card-implementation push — Secrets of Strixhaven (`sos`, 271 distinct cards)

Standing workstream: implement the Secrets of Strixhaven set for **limited (40-card) play** in
`mtg-core`, easiest-first, correctness over count. This ledger is the capability index + full
per-card triage, modeled on `SELESNYA_LANDFALL_CARDS.md`.

**Card data lives in the SQLite index, never memory** (CLAUDE.md "Card data"):
```
sqlite3 data/scryfall/cards.sqlite \
  "SELECT mana_cost,type_line,power,toughness,oracle_text,rarity
     FROM cards WHERE set_code='sos' AND name='<card>' ORDER BY released_at DESC LIMIT 1;"
```
Always re-read the oracle text from the db before authoring a card.

## Folder placement (first-printing rule)

Per repo convention a card lives in its **first-printing real-expansion** folder. For SoS that is
`sos/` for **255** of the 271 (the promo/prerelease codes `psos`/`pvow` collapse to `sos`/`vow`).
The genuine older reprints go elsewhere and **may already exist / should be reused, not duplicated**:

| Card | folder | note |
|---|---|---|
| Essence Scatter | `m10` | reprint |
| Last Gasp | `rav` | reprint |
| Quick Study | `woe` | reprint |
| Seize the Spoils | `khm` | reprint |
| Terramorphic Expanse | `tsp` | reprint (verify first-print at author time) |
| Ancestral Anger, Deathcap Glade, Dreamroot Cascade, Shattered Sanctum, Stormcarved Coast, Sundown Pass | `vow` | Crimson Vow reprints (6) |

`Erode` (`sos`) and the five basics (`misc`) are **already implemented** — reuse.

## Triage summary (2026-07-03)

271 distinct cards triaged against the **current** engine (Selesnya-push IR + Crew + Warp):

| Tier | Meaning | Count |
|---|---|---|
| **T1** | vanilla / french-vanilla (implemented keywords only) | **6** (5 basics done + Rearing Embermare) |
| **T2** | expressible in existing IR, **no new cap** | **68** |
| **T3** | needs one small card-agnostic cap (an S-cap below) | **142** |
| **T4** | needs a major subsystem — **deferred** | **55** (36 modal-DFC + 19 subsystem cards) |

The DFC bucket is deferred by CLAUDE.md first-pass scope ("double-faced / split … leave unbuilt").
So the reachable near-term pool is **T1 + T2 (74) then the T3 long tail (142)** as caps land.

## Capability ledger — small caps SoS needs (S-caps)

Card-agnostic caps to build in the Selesnya style (new `EventPattern` / `ValueExpr` / `Condition` /
`Effect` leaf / `Qualification` / `Rewrite` / `TokenSpec` field). Build **highest-leverage first**;
each cap unlocks the bracketed count. `⏳` = not yet built.

| Cap | What it adds | Cards | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S1** Surveil N | look at top N, put any number in graveyard, rest back (CR 701.42) — `Effect::Surveil` | 15 | ✅ **DONE** `cc58a7b` |
| **S5** Opus | `SpellCast(I/S you control)` trigger + `ValueExpr::ManaSpentOnTrigger` + `≥5` condition | 13 | ✅ **DONE** `e85771e` |
| **S8** Repartee | `SpellCast(I/S you control **that targets a creature**)` trigger (inspect cast targets) | 12 | ⏳ |
| **S4** Infusion | per-turn per-player "gained life this turn" state + a `Condition` reading it | 12 | ✅ **DONE** `89b3581` |
| **S10** Flashback | alt-cast from graveyard for a flashback cost, then exile (Warp-analogue) | 11 | ⏳ |
| **S6** Increment | `SpellCast(you)` trigger + condition "mana spent > this creature's power OR toughness" | 9 | ⏳ |
| **S7** Converge | `ValueExpr::ColorsOfManaSpent` (ETB counters / X in Converge spells) | 9 | ⏳ |
| **S9** Graveyard-leave | "cards leave your graveyard" trigger + "a card left your graveyard this turn" cond | 8 | ⏳ |
| **S2** Look-and-pick | look at top N, put one/some in hand, rest on bottom (impulse selection) | 8 | ⏳ |
| **S12** Cost-reduction cond. | "costs {N} less if it targets X / you control Y / a card left your gy" (cast-time) | 7 | ⏳ |
| **S14** Copy spell/perm | "copy target spell", "create a token that's a copy of" (heavier small-cap) | 7 | ⏳ |
| **S17** Ward {cost} | Ward N / Ward—Pay life / Ward—Discard (counter-unless-pay on becoming targeted) | 7 | ⏳ |
| **S15** Impulse play | exile/mill → "you may play it until end of turn / your next turn" | 6 | ⏳ |
| **S3** Stun counters | `CounterKind::Stun` + "would untap → remove a stun counter instead" replacement | 6 | ⏳ |
| **S18** Graveyard-activated | an ability that functions while its card is in the graveyard (recursion) | 6 | ⏳ |
| **S11** Token-with-ability | `TokenSpec` carries an ability (Treasure `{T},Sac`; Pest attack→gain life) | 5 | ⏳ |
| **S13** Restricted mana | mana usable "only to cast instant and sorcery spells" (spend-restriction tag) | 4 | ⏳ |
| **S16** Gain-life trigger | `EventPattern::GainLife` ("whenever you gain life, …") | 3 | ✅ **DONE** |
| **S21** cast-with-{X} trigger | `SpellCast` filtered to "has {X} in its cost" | 2 | ⏳ |
| **S19/S20/S22** | cards-drawn-this-turn value / counters-on-target value / cast-I/S-this-turn cond | 1 ea | ⏳ |
| **misc one-offs** | GreatestMV, DistinctNames, SoftCounter (counter-unless-pay), DirectedDiscard, AltCost, PayXLife, NoMaxHand, GrantAbility | 1–3 ea | ⏳ |
| **Native** | genuine one-offs via the `Native` escape hatch: Mathemagics (2^X), Pox Plague (halving), Steal the Show (wheel) | 4 | ⏳ |

Building **S1, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S10** (the seven big-count caps) converts ~**79** T3 cards to authorable.

## Engine reality-check — unimplemented effect leaves (E-caps) — **found during Phase 2**

The Phase-1 rubric assumed several `Effect` variants were interpreted; grepping the whiteboard
interpreter (`whiteboard.rs`) shows **six IR leaves are defined but interpreted nowhere** — a card
using one silently no-ops. So the true near-term T2 pool is **smaller than the 68 tallied above**:
some of those cards actually need one of these leaves wired first. These are the highest-leverage
caps (each is a small, card-agnostic interpreter arm lowering to an already-existing `Action`).

| E-cap | Effect leaf | Blocks (examples) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **E1** | `Effect::MoveZone` (bounce / return-to-hand / reanimate) | Zealous Lorecaster, Banishing Betrayal, Proctor's Gaze, Prismari Charm, Matterbending Mage, Pull from the Grave, Moment of Reckoning, Lorehold Charm | ✅ **DONE** `0e85b76` (single-target; multi-target "up to two" still TODO) |
| **E2** | `Effect::Counter` (counter target spell), respecting `CantBeCountered` | Essence Scatter, Brush Off, Mana Sculpt, Quandrix Charm | ✅ **DONE** `eb2b364` (+ stack-zone static gathering; closed Surrak's deferral) |
| **E3** | `Effect::Discard` (loot "then discard a card"; "target player discards") | Traumatic Critique, Stadium Tidalmage, Charging Strifeknight, Rubble Rouser, Colossus, Rapturous Moment, Borrowed Knowledge, Send in the Pest | ✅ **DONE** `506baf9` |
| **E4** | `Effect::Sacrifice` (as an effect — "each player sacrifices", "sacrifice two lands") | Planar Engineering, Witherbloom Charm, Social Snub (needs S14 copy too), Pox Plague | ✅ **DONE** `b5ea234` (per-player: Controller / EachPlayer / EachOpponent) |
| **E5** | `Effect::Repeat` | (few) | ⏳ |
| **E6** | `Effect::Distribute` | (few) | ⏳ |

**Loud guard (`8604b34`):** `materialize()` is now an **exhaustive** match — a defined-but-unwired
`Effect` leaf `debug_assert!`s loudly in debug/tests instead of silently no-oping (the bug class that
hid Traumatic Critique's discard), and a NEW IR variant with no arm is a *compile* error. The only
remaining loud-assert leaves are E5 `Repeat`, E6 `Distribute`, and `Native` (no runtime yet).

**Wired today (safe for T2 authoring):** DealDamage, Draw, Destroy, Exile, GainLife, LoseLife, PumpPT,
GrantKeyword, GrantQualification, BecomeCreature, AddMana, PutCounters, CreateToken, Fight, Search,
Tap, Modal, Optional, IfYouDo, ForEach, Conditional, Earthbend, **MoveZone, Discard, Counter (new)**.

Next-highest leverage: **E4 Sacrifice** (each-player-sacrifices / sac-as-effect), then the S-caps
(S1 Surveil, S4 Infusion, S5 Opus, …).

## Deferred subsystems (T4 — do NOT build now)

| Subsystem | Cards | Count |
|---|---|---|
| Modal double-faced (DFC) | the `… // …` cards (Emeritus cycle, all creature/spell MDFCs) | 36 |
| Lesson / **Paradigm** (recast-copy-from-exile each main phase) | Decorum Dissertation, Echocasting Symposium, Germination Practicum, Improvisation Capstone, Restoration Seminar | 5 |
| **Planeswalker** loyalty | Professor Dellian Fel, Ral Zarek Guest Lecturer | 2 |
| **Prepare / prepared** marker | Biblioplex Tomekeeper, Skycoach Waypoint | 2 |
| **Storm** | Prismari, the Inspiration | 1 |
| **Cascade** | Quandrix, the Proof | 1 |
| **Miracle** | Lorehold, the Historian | 1 |
| **Casualty** | Silverquill, the Disputant | 1 |
| **Affinity** (dynamic cost) | Witherbloom, the Balancer | 1 |

## 10 easiest (author these first — all T1/T2, no new cap)

1. **Quick Study** — `{2}{U}` draw two cards. Pure `Draw`.
2. **Rearing Embermare** — `{4}{R}` 4/5, "Reach, haste" — french-vanilla (T1).
3. **Last Gasp** — `{1}{B}` target creature gets −3/−3 EOT. `PumpPT`.
4. **Essence Scatter** — `{1}{U}` counter target creature spell. `Counter`.
5. **Wander Off** — `{3}{B}` exile target creature. `Exile`.
6. **Grapple with Death** — `{1}{B}{G}` destroy target artifact/creature, gain 1. `Destroy`+`GainLife`.
7. **Interjection** — `{W}` +2/+2 and first strike EOT. `PumpPT`+`GrantKeyword`.
8. **Chase Inspiration** — `{U}` +0/+3 and hexproof EOT. `PumpPT`+`GrantKeyword`.
9. **Oracle's Restoration** — `{G}` +1/+1 EOT, draw a card, gain 1. `PumpPT`+`Draw`+`GainLife`.
10. **Cost of Brilliance** — `{2}{B}` target player draws 2 & loses 2; +1/+1 on up-to-one creature.

(Deep T2 bench also ready: Dissection Practice, Traumatic Critique, Sneering Shadewriter,
Environmental Scientist, Harsh Annotation, Vibrant Outburst, Masterful Flourish, Shopkeeper's Bane.)

## 10 hardest (all T4 — deferred; here for the record)

1. **Prismari, the Inspiration** — Elder Dragon; grants **Storm** to all your I/S spells.
2. **Quandrix, the Proof** — Elder Dragon; has **Cascade** and grants it to your I/S.
3. **Lorehold, the Historian** — Elder Dragon; grants **Miracle {2}** to I/S in hand.
4. **Silverquill, the Disputant** — Elder Dragon; your I/S have **Casualty 1**.
5. **Witherbloom, the Balancer** — Elder Dragon; **Affinity for creatures** + grants it (dynamic cost).
6. **Professor Dellian Fel** — planeswalker; 4 loyalty abilities + emblem (whole PW subsystem).
7. **Ral Zarek, Guest Lecturer** — planeswalker; −7 "flip five coins, skip X turns".
8. **Restoration Seminar** (+ the 4 other Lessons) — **Paradigm**: exile & recast a free copy each main phase.
9. **Nita, Forum Conciliator** — cast spells you don't own + exile-and-cast opponents' graveyard spells.
10. **Petrified Hamlet** — ETB choose a card name, then name-scoped static grants/restrictions.

## Authoring plan

1. **T1/T2 sweep** — the 68 T2 + Rearing Embermare need no engine work; author them first (each: data
   IR + expect-test snapshot + a behaviour test for any effect; honest `fully_implemented`). This is
   the bulk of the immediately-shippable pool.
2. **Cap-then-cards** — build S-caps highest-leverage first (S1 Surveil, then S4/S5/S6/S7/S8/S10), each
   its own commit in the card-agnostic style (new IR node + tests), then author the T3 cards that cap
   unlocks. Keep `cargo test -p mtg-core` green at every commit.
3. **Defer T4** — mark deferred here, do not build. If a T3 card has one deferrable clause beyond its
   cap, ship the core with a documented `// deferred:` note (the established Humility/Rancor pattern).
4. A `sos_limited` preset deck once enough of the pool is playable.
